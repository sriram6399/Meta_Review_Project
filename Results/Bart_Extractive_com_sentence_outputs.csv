To this end, the authors introduce an intrinsic reward inspired by the exploration bonus of LinUCB. This novel exploration method called anti-concentrated confidence bounds (ACB) provably approximates the elliptical exploration bonus of LinUCB by using an ensemble of least-squares regressors. This allows ACB to bypass costly covariance matrix inversion, which can be problematic for high-dimensional problems (hence allowing it to be used in large state spaces). Empirical experiments show that ACB enjoys near-optimal performance in linear stochastic bandits. However, experiments",0.8335988521575928,0.31874582171440125

However, the authors note that when occluding pixels, classifiers are still functions of the occlusions themselves, so this process may introduce a bias as a result. This is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where a convolutional architecture classifies various occluded images as ""jigsaw"" or ""crossword puzzle",0.8401243090629578,0.29165444026390713

The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language",0.8311172723770142,0.28058697283267975

The constraint set is quite natural for e. g. multi-class classification, where the output has to stay on on the probability manifold. The challenge here is that traditional universal approximation theory only guarantees that f^(x)≈f(x), but can not guarantee that f^(x) lies exactly in the same constraint set as f(x). The paper made a significant contribution in the theory of deep learning -- It is shown that the neural network can indeed approximate any regular functions while keep the output stay in the regular constraint set.
