"The paper presents an approach to learn the surrogate loss for complex prediction tasks where the task loss is non-differentiable and non-decomposable. The novelty of the approach is to rely on differentiable sorting, optimizing the spearman correlation between the true loss and the surrogate.

The paper is well written and the approach clearly presented.

"This work identifies an interesting bias that can occur when applying occlusion based interpretability methods to debug image classifiers. For context, the motivation behind many of these methods is that by occluding various parts of the image, one can ask counterfactuals such as ""what would the model have predicted if this object were not present in the image""? However, the authors note that when occluding pixels, classifiers are still functions of the occlusions themselves, so this process may introduce a bias as a result. This is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where a convolutional architecture classifies various occluded images as ""jigsaw"" or ""crossword puzzle","This paper studies the problem of how to handle the bias between the classifier and the input data.

One can plan about more abstract textual domains. It adapts the standard methods from planning to such text domains in a fairly straightforward way.

The results can, in principle, therefore overcome several standard limitations with irregular data storage formats. The results improve over existing (though related) techniques. ### Discussion #### Strenghts - An interesting and timely topic to study - Results show non-compute improvements #### Weakness The primary weakness noted among the reviewers was the lack of study on actual decoding performance. As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I",This paper proposes a new method for improving the efficiency of a multi-task neural network.

This is a generalization of orthogonality of linear classifiers (linear classifiers with orthogonal weights) to the non-linear setting.

The paper proposes an approach and specific training algorithm to defend against membership inference attacks (MIA) in machine learning models.

"This paper advances the long running thread of sequence modelling research focussed on differentiable instantiations of stack based models. In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language","This paper proposes a new method for training a neural network based on a multi-task model.

"This manuscript proposes and analyses can approach to address the centralized and personalized tasks in federated learning jointly. Existing work has tackled this issue by developing separate tasks. Instead, this manuscript proposes a shared architecture that aims to optimize centralized and personalized models. One observation motivating this work is that local models trained during federated learning effectively optimize local task performance. The resulting approach results well when label shifts primarily drive the client variability. Here, the centralized components are trained to optimize a balanced risk, while the local components are trained to optimize the standard empirical risk.

"The paper studies an interesting question of whether neural networks can approximate the target function while keep the output in the constraint set. The constraint set is quite natural for e. g. multi-class classification, where the output has to stay on on the probability manifold. The challenge here is that traditional universal approximation theory only guarantees that f^(x)≈f(x), but can not guarantee that f^(x) lies exactly in the same constraint set as f(x). The paper made a significant contribution in the theory of deep learning -- It is shown that the neural network can indeed approximate any regular functions while keep the output stay in the regular constraint set.
