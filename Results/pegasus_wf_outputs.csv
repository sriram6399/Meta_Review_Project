This paper provides a near-optimal analysis of the unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm with respect to the W2 distance.

The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting contribution obtained via non-trivial techniques. The consensus recommendation is to accept the paper.,"Originality: The authors improve upon existing work to obtain a 2-Wasserstein mixing time bound of O(d0.5/epilson) for LMC.<n>Clarity: The article could be better written.

"The paper presents an approach to learn the surrogate loss for complex prediction tasks where the task loss is non-differentiable and non-decomposable. The novelty of the approach is to rely on differentiable sorting, optimizing the spearman correlation between the true loss and the surrogate. This leads to a pipeline that is simpler to integrate to existing works than approaches that try to learn a differentiable approximation to the task loss, and to better experimental results. The paper is well written and the approach clearly presented. The reviewers liked the simplicity of the approach and the promising experimental results on a variety of challenging tasks (human pose estimation and machine reading).","Loss functions matter a lot to the performance, while the current hand-craft losses often align poorly to the performance.<n>This paper proposes a new learning method by revisiting the purpose of loss functions, which is to distinguish the performance of models.<n>Instead of directly approximating the evaluation metrics as previous methods, this paper proposes a new learning method by revisiting the purpose of loss functions.",0.8402023911476135,0.5110364317893982

"This work identifies an interesting bias that can occur when applying occlusion based interpretability methods to debug image classifiers. For context, the motivation behind many of these methods is that by occluding various parts of the image, one can ask counterfactuals such as ""what would the model have predicted if this object were not present in the image""? However, the authors note that when occluding pixels, classifiers are still functions of the occlusions themselves, so this process may introduce a bias as a result. This is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where a convolutional architecture classifies various occluded images as ""jigsaw"" or ""crossword puzzle"", arguably due to the","The paper claims that a ‘hole’ cannot be left in the image in convolutional networks.

"Reviewers all found the work well-motivated in addressing uncertainty, a topic that has not seen much focus in meta-learning and few-shot learning. They describe the challenges well: small sample sizes and OOD shift. They then propose a solution they find works well empirically to overcome these challenges based on a set encoder and an energy function respectively. The proposal is largely one of engineering components that have been found to work well in the literature.

"The paper develops an unrolled version of the PALM algorithm for sparse blind (or semi-blind) source separation. The unrolled version includes a soft-thresholding update, in which the thresholding parameter and one of the weight matrices is learned from data, with a least squares dictionary update, in which the step size is learned from data. The paper provides experimental results showing that this LPALM algorithm is less sensitive to the choice of hyper parameters (since step sizes, etc. are learned from data), and to the choice of the initial dictionary (perhaps since the W matrices are learned from similar examples). It also improves over PALM on experimental data from an astronomy problem.

"This paper tackles the problem of feature interactions identification in black-box models, which is an important problem towards achieving explainable AI/ML. The authors formulate the problem under the multi-armed bandit setting and propose a solution based on the UCB algorithm. This simplification of the problem leads to a computationally feasible solution, for which the authors provide several theoretical analyses. The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/","The ParaACE model is a nice idea for model compression, and it shows promise.<n>My main concern is that there appears to be a much more computationally efficient baseline that the authors have overlooked.",0.8385650515556335,0.34566530585289
"This paper introduces the ""reversible instance normalization"" (RevIN), a method for addressing temporal distribution shift in time-series forecasting. RevIN consists in normalizing (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) each layer of of deep neural network in a given temporal window for a given instance, and de-normalizing by introducing learnable shifting and scaling parameters. The paper initially received one weak accept and two weak reject recommendations. The main limitations pointed out by reviewers relate to the limited novelty of the approach, the positioning with window normalization methods and hybrid methods in times series, and clarifications on experiments.

"The paper examines the approach of modeling aleatoric uncertainty by fitting a neural network, that estimates mean and variances of a heteorscedasitic Gaussian distribution, based on log likelihood maximization. The authors identify the problem that gradient based training on the netgative log likelihood (NLL) may result in suboptimal solutions where a high predicted variance compensates for the predicted mean being far from the true mean.

"The paper studies the problem of task-specific model compression obtained from fine-tuning large pre-trained language models. The work follows the line of research in which model size is reduced by decomposing the matrices in the model into smaller factors. Two-step approaches apply SVD and then fine-tuned the model on task specific data. The present work makes the observation that after the first step (the SVD compression) the model can dramatically lose its performance, due to the mismatched optimization objectives between the low-rank approximation and the target task. The work provides evidence backing this claim. The paper proposes to address this problem by weighting the importance of parameters for the factorization according to the Fisher information.",The approach does not require re-training (doing pre-training again) experimental results on several tasks show only a small drop in model quality.<n>The reduction in the number of parameters is modest compared to methods that re-train the network in a compact representation.,0.8463289141654968,0.37636391818523407
This paper develops a preference-conditioned” approach to approximate the Pareto frontier for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems with a single model (thus dealing with the thorny problem that there can be exponentially-many Pareto-optimal solutions). It appears to provide flexibility for users to obtain various preferred tradeoffs between the objectives without extra search. The basic idea is to use end-to-end RL to train the single model for all different preferences simultaneously. The technical soundness and practical performance are strong.

Although the novelty of the method is not high, it is simple and effective in experiments after the supplementary sota results in the long rebuttal. Majority of reviewers increase their ratings after the rebuttal (though one reviewer promised this but forgot to act), while some","The proposed approach is technically sound in general.<n>The empirical evaluations are not self-contained, somewhat weak, and incomplete.<n>More experimental results and ablation studies should be included in the main text.",0.8228435516357422,0.3270520716905594
"This paper proposes a new bilinear decomposition for universal value functions. The bilinear network has one component dependent on state and goal and another component that depends on state and action. The experiments with the DDPG algorithm in robot simulations show that the proposed architecture improves performance data efficiency and task transfer over several baseline algorithms, including improvements on earlier bilinear decompositions. The reviews noted several aspects of the paper could be improved, and the author response addressed several of these concerns. Multiple reviewers appreciated the insights from the experiment added in section 4.5 on a simple grid environment, which enabled a direct interpretation of the vector fields used in the method. Several aspects of the presentation were clarified based on the reviewers comments.

"The focus of the paper is kernel thinning, i. e. the extraction of a core set from a sample with good integration properties meant in MMD (maximum mean discrepancy, hence worst case) sense. Particularly, the authors propose generalizations of the kernel thinning method (Dwivedi and Mackey, 2021) which relax the assumptions imposed on the kernel (k) and the target distribution (P), and possess tighter performance guarantees. Designing compressed representation of samples for integration is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics with a large number of successful applications.

"This paper investigates defense against backdoor attacks for models that have already been trained. It proposes, in particular, a min-max formulation for backdoor defense, in which the inner maximum seeks a powerful trigger that leads to a high loss, while the outer minimum seeks to suppress the ""adversarial loss"", so as to unlearn the injected backdoor behaviors. To solve the minimax, the authors also propose a method, Implicit Backdoor Adversarial Unlearning (I-BAU). In addition, the authors also provide theoretical analysis including the convergence bound and generalization bound. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method is interesting and the implementation is nice.

The results can, in principle, therefore overcome several standard limitations with irregular data storage formats. The results improve over existing (though related) techniques. ### Discussion #### Strenghts - An interesting and timely topic to study - Results show non-compute improvements #### Weakness The primary weakness noted among the reviewers was the lack of study on actual decoding performance. As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I",I like the motivation of this paper which is a very important problem in practice.<n>The experimental results look promising and the theoretical analysis is sound to me.<n>No mention of the actual computational performance of the method.,0.8385947942733765,0.35067334646979964

"PAPER: This paper introduces a new method to learn joint representations from multimodal data, with potentially missing data. The primary novelty builds from the idea of semi-supervised VAE, introducing the concept of bi-directional information flow, which is termed “mutual supervision”. This approach brings the same advantages of semi-supervised VAE to the multimodal setting, allowing the cross-modal interactions to be modeled in the latent space. DISCUSSION: The discussion brought many important issues, addressed by both reviewers and authors. In general, it seems that most reviewers appreciate the technical novelty of the paper, related to the mutual supervision. While some concerns were expressed about the similarity with semi-supervised VAE (Joy","The proposed MEME is a straightforward extension of an existing semi-supervised VAE to a multimodal setting.<n>Experiments confirm the effectiveness of MEME compared to MVAE and MMVAE in both partial and complete data settings.<n>The technical novelty is limited, except for extending the work of a semi-supervised VAE.",0.8596342206001282,0.528813182686766

Existing MIA attacks are relatively simple and rely on the test loss distribution at the query point and therefore the proposed algorithm sets a positive target mean training loss value and applies gradient ascent if the average loss of current training batch is smaller than it (in addition to the standard gradient descent step). The submission gives extensive experimental results demonstrating advantage over existing defense methods on several benchmarks. The primary limitation of the work is that it defends only against rather naive existing attacks which do not examine the model (but rely only on the loss functions).,The proposed method outperforms similar defense strategies while preserving the accuracy of the classification model on test data.<n>Their defense strategy is computationally efficient (in comparison with other similar methods) and blind to the attack algorithm.<n>The paper lacks intuition behind some assumptions and choices made in designing the algorithm.,0.8424921035766602,0.5764009281992912

"This paper is about unsupervised translation between programming languages.

Results show a substantial improvement. The main weaknesses are that there are some caveats that need to be made, such as the (heuristic, not learned) way that test cases are translated across languages is not fully general, and that limits the applicability.

In general, outer loop optimization requires backpropagating over trajectories involving gradient updates in the inner loop optimization. It is claimed that one of main advantages of COMLN is able to compute the exact meta-gradients in a memory-efficient way, regardless of the length of adaptation trajectory. To this end, the forward-mode differentiation is used, with exploiting the Jacobian matrix decomposition. All the reviewers agree that the derivation of memory-efficient forward-mode differentiation is a significant contribution in the few-shot learning.

The paper demonstrates it very thoroughly through many experiments and analysis of the loss surfaces. ### Decision + Discussion I find the paper to be very timely in its context.

"This paper advances the long running thread of sequence modelling research focussed on differentiable instantiations of stack based models. In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness.

"The authors introduce a method for improving reinforcement learning in sparse reward settings. In particular, they propose to take advantage of a suboptimal behavior policy as a guidance policy that is incorporated in a TRPO-like update. The reviewers agree that this is a novel and interesting idea and given the authors' rebuttal with additional experiments, clarifications and discussions, they agreed to accept the paper. However, they also point out several flaws (e. g. evaluation on a more challenging sparse-reward task such as Adroid) that I encourage the authors to address in the final version of the paper.",This paper contributes a useful and apparently novel algorithm for an important problem in the application of RL methods in real-world settings.<n>One of the best strengths of the proposed LOGO method is that the double-TRPO structure allows this to be easily implemented using existing TRPOptions.<n>The discussion of related work seems to be missing a few recent papers that might be relevant.,0.849154531955719,0.34132854267954826
"This paper explores ways in which *emergent communication* (EC) methods from representation learning can be evaluated extrinsically, by hooking them into downstream NLP tasks. Reviewers agree that the paper is thorough, and finds encouraging results. This paper is borderline, and difficult to evaluate, even after very substantial discussion (some of it private). From my reading of the reviews and pieces of the paper, I'm very sympathetic to wvqW's concern that none of the present-day applications under study seem likely to benefit from this kind of emergent communication pretraining: *Natural* language pretraining, even transferring across natural languages, is for too strong a baseline, and it's not even","The paper's very clearly written, well-organized, and much of the discussion was grounded in a broad range of references.<n>My concerns with this paper are in regards the experimental design, the strength of the conclusions, and how the authors are choosing to interpret them.",0.8358526825904846,0.48546312749385834
"The authors introduce the Time-Aware Multiperistence Spatio-Supra Graph CN that uses multiparameter persistence to capture the latent time dependencies in spatio-temporal data. This is a novel and experimentally well-supported work. The novelty is achieved by combining research in topological analysis (multipersistence) and neural networks. Technically sound. Clear presentation and extensive experimental section. Reviewers were uniformly positive, agreeing that the approach was interesting and well-motivated, and the experiments convincing. Some concerns that were raised were successfully addressed by the authors and revised in the manuscript. Happy to recommend acceptance.

"This paper proposes a message passing neural network to solve PDEs. The paper has sound motivation, clear methodology, and extensive empirical study. However, on the other hand, some reviewers also raised their concerns, especially regarding the lack of clear notations and sufficient discussions on the difference between the proposed method and previous works. Furthermore, there is no ablation study and the generalization to multiple spatial resolution is not clearly explained. The authors did a very good job during the rebuttal period: many concerns/doubts/questions from the reviewers were successfully addressed and additional experiments have been performed to support the authors' answers. As a result, several reviewers decided to raise their scores, and the overall assessment on the","I think the paper has a clarity issues and still in its early stages from that perspective.<n>The architecture, however, looks like a separate idea, which is not connected to the loss.<n>The dependence of the properties of the method on the number of parameters in the model is not studied.",0.8344897627830505,0.4062284976243973
"I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. All reviewers are unanimously leaning towards acceptance of this paper. Reviewers in particular liked that the paper is well-written and easy to follow [186e,TAdH,Exgo], well motivated [TAdH], interesting [PsKh], novel [186e] and provides gains over baselines [186e,TAdH,PsKh] with interesting ablations [186e,Exgo]. I thus recommend accepting the paper and I encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback.","This paper is well motivated and most parts are well written, but the main method section is written to be difficult to follow.<n>The results demonstrate empirical gains in the Jericho environment.<n>The ablation studies show the individual components introduced by XTX can bring improvements.",0.8290888071060181,0.4474582001566887
"This paper provides a very large-scale study on the pretraining of image recognition models. Specifically, three scaling factors (model sizes, dataset sizes, and training time) are extensively investigated. One important phenomenon observed by this paper is that stronger upstream accuracy may not necessarily contribute to stronger performance on downstream tasks---actually sometimes these two types of performance could even be at odds with each other Overall, all the reviewers enjoy reading this paper and highly appreciate the empirical results presented in this paper. There were only a few concerns raised by the reviewers but most were well addressed during the discussion period. All reviewers reach a consensus on accepting this paper and believe this study is worthy to be heard by the community.","I like the introduction -- I think it does a good job of setting up the problem and framing what you're going to do, but I feel like you lose that framing as soon as you branch into other sections.<n>I think using accuracy is standard in the field, but I'd be further interested in other metrics like AUROC.",0.8235333561897278,0.3845705658197403
"The paper studies an interesting question of whether neural networks can approximate the target function while keep the output in the constraint set. The constraint set is quite natural for e. g. multi-class classification, where the output has to stay on on the probability manifold. The challenge here is that traditional universal approximation theory only guarantees that f(x)f(x), but can not guarantee that f(x) lies exactly in the same constraint set as f(x). The paper made a significant contribution in the theory of deep learning -- It is shown that the neural network can indeed approximate any regular functions while keep the output stay in the regular constraint set. This gives",The paper shows the first universal approximation with constraints.<n>The general theory shows that the universal transformer can use the probabilistic approximation to project suboptimal outputs.,0.8437263369560242,0.45121894936476437
"This is a strong empirical paper that studies scaling laws for NMT in terms of several new aspects, such as the model quality as a function of the encoder and decoder sizes, and how the composition of data affects scaling, etc. The extensive empricial results offer new insights to the questions and provide valuable guidance for future research on deep NMT.

"The authors present a method called ""AdaRL"" that learns a structured latent representation that characterizes relationships between different variables in an RL system. The method is evaluated on modified Pong and Cart-Pole domains and it is shown to outperform other transfer learning baselines. The reviewers agree that the method makes sense and addresses an important problem of transfer in RL. The authors did a good job in the rebuttal to empirically validate their claims and provided extra experiments. The reviewers also point out that the evaluated domains are rather simple and the paper would benefit from evaluations in a more complex environment as well as better writing. Please focus on improving these aspects in the final version of the paper.","The proposed method is novel, it has significant differences compared to previous methods.<n>I think the explicit factorization is great and that the results are impressive.<n>My two main concerns are clarity and the quality of the empirical evaluations.",0.8428878784179688,0.3849669322371483
"This paper introduces a novel SE(3) equivariant graph matching network, along with a keypoint discovery and alignment approach, for the problem of protein-protein docking, with a novel loss based on optimal transport.

"This paper introduces a new type of language model, the GNN-LM, which uses a graph neural network to allow a language model to reference similar contexts in the training corpus in addition to the input context. The empirical results are good, and the model sets a new SOTA on the benchmark Wikitext-103 corpus, as well as improving over strong baselines on two other language modeling datasets (enwiki8 and Billion Word Benchmark). The main drawback, as noted by one reviewer, is the computational expense of the method with significant slowdowns compared to the baseline. Two reviewers voted strong accept, with a third raising several concerns. The largest concern was the lack of comparison to prior work,","The work is among the studies of enhancing language generation by context retrieval.<n>The proposed model is compared with a retrieval-augmented baseline only on WikiText-103.<n>Since the major contribution of the work is the GNN module, it would be important to demonstrate how useful the component is.",0.8472814559936523,0.45053079463541507
"The authors propose a memory-based continual learning method that decomposes the models' parameters and that shares a large number of the decomposed parameters across tasks. In other words, only a small number of parameters are task-specific and the memory usage of storing models from previous tasks is hence a fraction of the memory usage of previous approaches. The authors take advantage of their method to propose specific ensembling approaches and demonstrate the strong performance of their methods using several datasets. In the rebuttal, the authors were very reactive and provided many useful additional results during including a comparison of the computational cost of their method vs. others, results using two new datasets (CUBS & Flowers), and additional results on mini",I do not agree with the first sentence of the introduction.<n>I think only the results of the two datasets are not enough to support the author's conclusion strongly.,0.8361666202545166,0.2772453799843788
"This paper proposes an innovative method for continual learning that modifies the direction of gradients on a new task to minimise forgetting on previous tasks without data replay. The method is mathematically rigorous with a strong theoretical analysis and excellent empirical results across multiple continual learning benchmarks. It is a clear accept. There was good discussion between the reviewers and authors that addressed a number of minor issues, including clarifying that the method has the same computational complexity as backpropagation. The authors are encouraged to make sure that these points are addressed in the final version of the paper.","Overall, I think this is a nice idea and a good application of it.<n>I focus the rest of the review on various ways I think the paper could be improved further.",0.8382357358932495,0.37584376260638236
