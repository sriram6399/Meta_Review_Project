To this end, the authors introduce an intrinsic reward inspired by the exploration bonus of LinUCB. This novel exploration method called anti-concentrated confidence bounds (ACB) provably approximates the elliptical exploration bonus of LinUCB by using an ensemble of least-squares regressors. This allows ACB to bypass costly covariance matrix inversion, which can be problematic for high-dimensional problems (hence allowing it to be used in large state spaces). Empirical experiments show that ACB enjoys near-optimal performance in linear stochastic bandits. However, experiments",0.8298171162605286,0.271754585703214

As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I",0.8447845578193665,0.3233696135381857

The submission gives extensive experimental results demonstrating advantage over existing defense methods on several benchmarks.

The reviewers agree that this paper is a good contribution to the community.,"This paper provides a very large-scale study on the pretraining of image recognition models. Specifically, three scaling factors (model sizes, dataset sizes, and training time) are extensively investigated. One important phenomenon observed by this paper is that stronger upstream accuracy may not necessarily contribute to stronger performance on downstream tasks---actually sometimes these two types of performance could even be at odds with each other Overall, all the reviewers enjoy reading this paper and highly appreciate the empirical results presented in this paper. There were only a few concerns raised by the reviewers but most were well addressed during the discussion period. All reviewers reach a consensus on accepting this paper and believe this study is worthy to be heard by the community.",0.8736684322357178,0.5582565695047379
"This paper proposes a new method for generating neural networks based on neural networks. The authors propose a method for using neural networks for neural networks that can be trained on a neural network. The paper proposes an approach for learning a graph based on a graph. The reviewers agree that the paper is well written and well written, and the experimental results are impressive. The main concern raised by the reviewers is the clarity of the experiments and the technical novelty of the paper. There were some remaining concerns about the paper, which were addressed by the authors in the rebuttal.","The paper studies an interesting question of whether neural networks can approximate the target function while keep the output in the constraint set. The constraint set is quite natural for e. g. multi-class classification, where the output has to stay on on the probability manifold. The challenge here is that traditional universal approximation theory only guarantees that f^(x)≈f(x), but can not guarantee that f^(x) lies exactly in the same constraint set as f(x). The paper made a significant contribution in the theory of deep learning -- It is shown that the neural network can indeed approximate any regular functions while keep the output stay in the regular constraint set. This gives",0.8342732191085815,0.32144044109043624

The authors have addressed some concerns raised by the reviewers. There were some concerns about the novelty of the paper, and the technical novelty of this paper. The main concerns raised have been addressed in the rebuttal, and were addressed by the authors in the final version.","The authors present a method called ""AdaRL"" that learns a structured latent representation that characterizes relationships between different variables in an RL system. The method is evaluated on modified Pong and Cart-Pole domains and it is shown to outperform other transfer learning baselines. The reviewers agree that the method makes sense and addresses an important problem of transfer in RL. The authors did a good job in the rebuttal to empirically validate their claims and provided extra experiments. The reviewers also point out that the evaluated domains are rather simple and the paper would benefit from evaluations in a more complex environment as well as better writing.

The empirical results are good, and the model sets a new SOTA on the benchmark Wikitext-103 corpus, as well as improving over strong baselines on two other language modeling datasets (enwiki8 and Billion Word Benchmark). The main drawback, as noted by one reviewer, is the computational expense of the method with significant slowdowns compared to the baseline. Two reviewers voted strong accept, with a third raising several concerns. The largest concern was the lack of comparison to",0.8553281426429749,0.45787115693092345

In other words, only a small number of parameters are task-specific and the memory usage of storing models from previous tasks is hence a fraction of the memory usage of previous approaches.
