All these support ACB as a viable exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning.,"This paper tackles the problem of exploration in Deep RL in settings with a large action space. To this end, the authors introduce an intrinsic reward inspired by the exploration bonus of LinUCB. This novel exploration method called anti-concentrated confidence bounds (ACB) provably approximates the elliptical exploration bonus of LinUCB by using an ensemble of least-squares regressors. This allows ACB to bypass costly covariance matrix inversion, which can be problematic for high-dimensional problems (hence allowing it to be used in large state spaces). Empirical experiments show that ACB enjoys near-optimal performance in linear stochastic bandits. However, experiments on Atari benchmark fail to show",0.8421833515167236,0.4000015196700891

The results can, in principle, therefore overcome several standard limitations with irregular data storage formats. The results improve over existing (though related) techniques. ### Discussion #### Strenghts - An interesting and timely topic to study - Results show non-compute improvements #### Weakness The primary weakness noted among the reviewers was the lack of study on actual decoding performance. As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I",0.8094488978385925,0.318072893222173
The paper provides a principled and interesting approach to an impactful problem. It seems that the paper is trying to solve a problem that it is already solved at the beginning. The acquisition function also needs more clarification: the authors choose to compute O instead of a fully defined pi* to avoid sampling unnecessary states.,"In this paper, the authors introduce an exploration method for RL according to experimental design perspective via designing an acquisition function, which quantifies how much information a state-action pair would provide about the optimal solution to a Markov decision process, and the state-action that maximizes such acquisition function will be used for sampling for policy update. The empirical evidences show the proposed method is promising. Since most of the reviewers support the paper, I recommend acceptance of this submission.

The proposed method outperforms similar defense strategies while preserving the accuracy of the classification model on test data. The authors did not discuss limitations of the method.,The paper proposes an approach and specific training algorithm to defend against membership inference attacks (MIA) in machine learning models.

The submission gives extensive experimental results demonstrating advantage over existing defense methods on several benchmarks.

The paper is well written and the mathematical formulation of rigid protein docking is nice. The authors promise they will release the code and datasets after reviewing the process.","This paper introduces a novel SE(3) equivariant graph matching network, along with a keypoint discovery and alignment approach, for the problem of protein-protein docking, with a novel loss based on optimal transport. The overall consensus is that this is an impactful solution to an important problem, whereby competitive results are achieved without the need for templates, refinement, and are achieved with substantially faster run times.",0.8785932064056396,0.4784143269062042
The paper proposes a unified framework for parameter-efficent tuning that includes several state-of-the-art methods as instantiations. The method Scaled PA consistently shows its advantages against the other baselines.,"The paper reviews and draws connections between several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. All reviewers found the paper addresses an important research problem, and the theoretical justification and empirical analyses are convincing.",0.8809096813201904,0.4329007491469383
"The authors propose an interesting hypothesis that referring to the training data could be helpful for language modeling, and they showed that the method is able to make considerable improvements over the vanilla LM.","This paper introduces a new type of language model, the GNN-LM, which uses a graph neural network to allow a language model to reference similar contexts in the training corpus in addition to the input context. The empirical results are good, and the model sets a new SOTA on the benchmark Wikitext-103 corpus, as well as improving over strong baselines on two other language modeling datasets (enwiki8 and Billion Word Benchmark). The main drawback, as noted by one reviewer, is the computational expense of the method with significant slowdowns compared to the baseline. Two reviewers voted strong accept, with a third raising several concerns. The largest concern was the lack of comparison to prior work,",0.8598130941390991,0.4540397584438324
The paper presents a new method to compute the distance between filter subspaces. The proposed method is based on the over- parameterization of deep models. The reviewers are positive about the paper and all reviewers agree that the paper is well written and the idea is simple and clear. There is a huge improvement in memory saving compared with other methods. The reviewers are positive about the paper and all reviewers agree that the paper is well written and the idea is simple and clear. There is a huge improvement in memory saving compared with other methods. The reviewers are positive about the paper and all reviewers agree that the paper is well written and the,"The authors propose a memory-based continual learning method that decomposes the models' parameters and that shares a large number of the decomposed parameters across tasks. In other words, only a small number of parameters are task-specific and the memory usage of storing models from previous tasks is hence a fraction of the memory usage of previous approaches. The authors take advantage of their method to propose specific ensembling approaches and demonstrate the strong performance of their methods using several datasets. In the rebuttal, the authors were very reactive and provided many useful additional results during including a comparison of the computational cost of their method vs. others, results using two new datasets (CUBS & Flowers), and additional results on mini",0.8320387005805969,0.3641509051833834
"The paper proposes an approach to continuous learning that uses a projection matrix for the gradient on a new task and a Bayes equation for the gradient on previous tasks. The reviewers agree that this is a nice idea and a good application of it. Overall, I think this is a nice idea and a good application of it. It is nice to be able to modify the gradient on a new task with a projection matrix, while minimising forgetting on past tasks. The authors argue that Single-Task Learning can be regarded as the strongest expansion-based method. I disagree that STL is the strongest baseline, as there is no potential for forward or","This paper proposes an innovative method for continual learning that modifies the direction of gradients on a new task to minimise forgetting on previous tasks without data replay. The method is mathematically rigorous with a strong theoretical analysis and excellent empirical results across multiple continual learning benchmarks. It is a clear accept. There was good discussion between the reviewers and authors that addressed a number of minor issues, including clarifying that the method has the same computational complexity as backpropagation. The authors are encouraged to make sure that these points are addressed in the final version of the paper.",0.8656787872314453,0.4302657226721446
