The paper is of high quality. It is well-structured and describes concisely and clearly,"In this paper, a new method is proposed to discover diverse policies solving a given task. The key ideas are to (1) learn one policy at a time, with each new policy trying to be different enough from the previous ones, and (2) switch between two rewards on a per-trajectory basis: the ""normal"" reward on trajectories that are unlikely enough under previoiusly discovered policies, and a ""diversity-inducing"" reward on trajectories that are too likely (so as to push the policy being learned away from the previous ones).

The paper is working on a new approach to gradient-based optimization for recurrent architecture,"This paper adapts a method called ""real-time recurrent learning"" for training recurrent neural networks. The idea is to project the true gradient onto a subspace of desired dimensionality along a candidate direction. There are a variety of possible candidates: random directions, backpropagation through time, meta-learning approaches, etc. The main strength of the paper is that it is a very simple idea that seems to have practical utility. While often presented in different contexts, it should be clearly noted by the authors that the general idea of using low dimensional directional derivatives for computational efficiency is fairly common in optimization.

The author response clarified important aspects of the paper. The new human evaluation was critical. However, the human evaluation result presentation is flawed: presenting Likert scores as means does not reflect them well. The authors should use something similar to a Gantt chart to fully reflect the distribution across Likert categories. Another detail in the human evaluation that are troubling: it does not reflect interaction with the system, but judgements through observation. Therefore, the human evaluation does not reflect the ability of the learned dialogue system to interact with users.

The approach is applicable when the approximate posterior is obtained via (stochastic gradient) MCMC methods. Unlearning is done by shifting the approximate true posterior by some value delta, which is found via optimisation with an influence function. The approach is novel, tackles an important problem and is mathematically sound. Reviewers have highlighted some of its limitations.

The method is compared to a variety of existing methods on Mujoco problems in “episodic reward” settings, where the reward is zero except for the final step of the episode, where it is the sum of rewards from the original task.

The intrinsic reward resulting from the so-called DISDAIN (discriminator disagreement intrinsic reward) exploration bonus is more tailored to the true objective compared to pseudocount-based methods.
