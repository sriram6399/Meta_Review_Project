"The paper provides a rigorous analysis of how generalized exploration bonuses for deep RL can be derived from fundamental exploration bonuses from linear stochastic bandits. Although the proposed ACB is not completely novel, the paper is well-motivated and the resultant algorithm is effective. The main contribution of this paper comes from applying ACB principle for exploration in deep RL.","This paper tackles the problem of exploration in Deep RL in settings with a large action space. To this end, the authors introduce an intrinsic reward inspired by the exploration bonus of LinUCB. This novel exploration method called anti-concentrated confidence bounds (ACB) provably approximates the elliptical exploration bonus of LinUCB by using an ensemble of least-squares regressors. This allows ACB to bypass costly covariance matrix inversion, which can be problematic for high-dimensional problems (hence allowing it to be used in large state spaces). Empirical experiments show that ACB enjoys near-optimal performance in linear stochastic bandits. However, experiments",0.8583207726478577
"I thank the authors for their article, which addresses the important topic of analytically understanding the convergence of the unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm.

"The proposed approach is well motivated and makes sense. The ReLoss gains noticeable improvements over baselines and outperforms the state-of-the-art method on COCO keypoint dataset. The method can be widely applied to NLP and CV tasks, and its benefits seem significant according to the experiments.","The paper presents an approach to learn the surrogate loss for complex prediction tasks where the task loss is non-differentiable and non-decomposable. The novelty of the approach is to rely on differentiable sorting, optimizing the spearman correlation between the true loss and the surrogate. This leads to a pipeline that is simpler to integrate to existing works than approaches that try to learn a differentiable approximation to the task loss, and to better experimental results. The paper is well written and the approach clearly presented. The reviewers liked the simplicity of the approach and the promising experimental results on a variety of challenging tasks (human pose estimation and machine reading).",0.8511677980422974

Overall, the paper is well written and clear.","This paper presents a way of using multigrid techniques to parallelize GRU networks across the time dimension. Reviewers are uniformly in favor of accepting the paper. The main strength is that the paper provides a new perspective on dealing with long input sequences by parallelizing RNNs across time.

There are several key pros of the paper that contribute to my favorable opinion. The writing is concise and easy to understand in general. The paper makes nontrivial theoretical progress. The introduction of top k predictions rather than top 1 prediction is an interesting contribution which extends the applicability of randomized ablation (i.e. ℓ0 smoothing),"Thank you for your submission to ICLR. The reviewers ultimately have mixed opinions on this paper, but reading in a bit more depth I don't feel that the critical comments raised by the sole negative reviewer really raise valid points. Specifically, the fact that this reviewer directly asks e. g. for comparisons to Levine and Feiz 2019, when the paper (before its revisions) contains an entire section devoted to exactly this comparison, strikes me as not sufficient for a thorough review. However, while I'm thus going to recommend the paper for acceptance (it does present a notable, if somewhat minor, advance upon the state of the art in randomized smoothing), I also feel the paper is",0.8366613388061523

The paper tackles an important and challenging problem faced in dimensionality reduction. The proposed method is simple and justified by existing research. The paper is hampered by a lack of notational clarity in essential sections that makes it difficult to determine the full contributions and impact of the proposed method.,"This paper proposes loss functions to encode topological priors during data embedding, based on persistence diagram constructions from computational topology. The paper initially had some expositional issues and technical questions, but the authors did an exceptional job of addressing them during the rebuttal period----nearly all reviewers raised their scores (or intended to but didn't update the numbers on their original reviews).

"Strengths: The paper focuses on an important problem of activation normalization which to my knowledge has not yet been properly explored in the continual learning setting. Weaknesses: Although the paper provides an empirical investigation of the issue, it would benefit from a more in-depth study of how different normalization schemes affect the results.","The paper sheds light on issues with BN in continual learning and proposes a quite simple, which is a strength, solution to fix it. The Authors first draw attention to the fact that using recalculated moments boosts performance and reduces forgetting, which serves as an argument that at least partially BN contributes to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Given that BN remains quite important in certain application areas such as vision, it is a strong motivation for the paper. The experiments are thorough and clearly show that CN is a practically relevant alternative to BN in continual learning. One weakness of the paper is that the method is poorly motivated, and relatedly, it has quite limited novelty. CN combines the strengths",0.8484513759613037
The model essentially relies on an object-centric view and the dynamics of each object are treated unitarily.

It does so by developing a way to build geometric constraints implicitly and naturally into the forward kinematics of the network, while still allowing for effective learning from data. The manuscript proves some essential properties of the new architecture and runs experiments both with simulated particles, hinges, sticks (and their combination), as well as with motion capture data.

The experiments are very limited to the LAMA probing which does not necessarily connect to real downstream applications of these LMs.,"The paper introduces the problem of continual knowledge (language) learning. The authors point out the interesting duality between continual learning and knowledge learning where: in knowledge learning one must avoid forgetting time-invariant knowledge (avoid forgetting in CL), be able to acquire new knowledge (learn new tasks in CL), and replace outdated knowledge (a form of forgetting and re-learning or adaptation).

"The proposed algorithm outperformed RS and other mentioned baselines, without too much computational overhead over RS. Strengths: The proposed methods seem well-suited to the current problem at hand.

For context, the motivation behind many of these methods is that by occluding various parts of the image, one can ask counterfactuals such as ""what would the model have predicted if this object were not present in the image""? However, the authors note that when occluding pixels, classifiers are still functions of the occlusions themselves, so this process may introduce a bias as a result. This is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where a convolutional architecture classifies various occluded images as ""jigsaw"" or ""crossword puzzle",0.8443813323974609
"This submission is empirical: the paper is well-motivated. The paper adapts existing, popular techniques to engineer a solution to the standing problem. The abstract and intro focus heavily on bi-Lipschitz regularized NN. The exposition in section 3 (except for Section 3.4 which is 10 lines long) relies minimally on this architecture.","Reviewers all found the work well-motivated in addressing uncertainty, a topic that has not seen much focus in meta-learning and few-shot learning. They describe the challenges well: small sample sizes and OOD shift. They then propose a solution they find works well empirically to overcome these challenges based on a set encoder and an energy function respectively. The proposal is largely one of engineering components that have been found to work well in the literature. I'm sympathetic to this style of research (particularly in today's neural network research), although the reviewers raise a primary concern about whether the choices leading to the proposal are justified.

The weakly-supervised setting seems to be new and has not been used in the previous literacture. The experiments where the method is conditioned on a subset of objects (Appendix) set by the user are really nice and open a broad range of applications for the proposed method. The main issue with the Slot attention model is the inability to capture natural texture/background and/or camera movement.,"This work proposes a new framework that can learn the object-centric representation for video. The authors did a good job during rebuttal and turned one slightly negative reviewer into positive ones. The final scores are 6,6,8,8. AC agrees that this work is very interesting and deserves to be published on ICLR. The reviewers did raise some valuable concerns that should be addressed in the final camera-ready version of the paper. The authors are also encouraged to make other necessary changes.",0.8412556052207947
"Strengths: By open-sourcing the checkpoints, others can take advantage of the trained models to foster research in various NLP applications. Weaknesses: The plots are often hard to read and have very bad visualization. The novelty of this paper is limited. The experiment results may be effected by the randomness.","The results reported in this paper and the model checkpoints released are of interest and broad utility to the community in the opinion of the NLP.

The AC therefore recommends acceptance.",0.8478633165359497
"The method proposed in this paper utilizes a reasonable approach based on state-of-the-art architectures and techniques. The paper is well-written, and the shown results look good given the dataset that is used for training. While the results are nice, I don't think they are ready to be put into a production-level system, in part due to the relative simplicity of the generated sketches.","The paper describes an approach for automatically generating CAD sketches, including both the primitives that describe the drawing, as well as the constraints that describe relationships between the primitives that need to be maintained even if the primitives are changed. This is an important problem that is starting to receive a lot of attention from the literature. Overall, the paper is very well executed and the results are quite compelling.

The paper proposes a new architecture based on their new operators and implementing the finite impulse response (FIR) filter recursively. The experiments in this paper are done on synthetically generated datasets for two applications of flocking and unlabelled motion planning. It is evident from the in-depth theoretical analysis that the author’s primary focus is to propose a novel architecture.,"This paper proposes a new time-varying convolutional architecture (ST-GNN) for dynamic graphs. The reviewers were positive about the presentation and detailed theory, especially on the stability analysis. The shared criticism was on experimental validation synthetic datasets that the reviewers did not find appealing.

We thus recommend to accept the paper.",0.8495774269104004
"The paper proposes an approach to scale rotationally equivariant convolutions on spherical domains to work with signals with arbitrary resolutions. This is accomplished by leveraging the properties of the scattering transform, by converting the input signal to the corresponding wavelet-based representation, before feeding it to some arbitrary spherical CNN architecture. The obtained representations are isometry invariant up to a given scale and stable to small diffeomorphisms.","The submission develops a rotationally equivariant scattering transform on the sphere. Many developments in deep learning make use of spherical representations, and the development of a rotationally equivariant scattering transform is an important if not unexpected development. The reviews are split with half of the reviewers believing it to be slightly above the threshold for acceptance, and half believe it to be slightly below the threshold for acceptance. In the papers favor, it solves an important case of the scattering transform framework, which has been demonstrated to be important in diverse machine learning applications such as learning with small data sets, differentially private learning, and network initialization. As such, continued fundamental development in this area is valuable, especially in",0.8361435532569885
"The results on the cold-posterior effect are also unstable between models, which is reported in the paper.

It shows empirically that, when trained via SGD, weights in feedforward neural networks exhibit heavy-tails, while weights in convolutional neural networks are spatially correlated. From this observation they show that the use of such priors leads to some improved performances compared to the iid Gaussian prior in some experimental settings.

On the plus side, the paper is very well written, the experimental part is carefully conducted, and provides some insights on the choice",0.8283549547195435
The idea presented is simple and yet novel. The authors have done well to address and rectify the potential issues around the on-policy feature of AlphaZero with HER. The results provided are clear and show that this approach can confer significant benefit over AlphaZero in a reward sparse setting. More formality and description in some areas of this paper could help.,"The main detractor of this paper feels that the paper makes a relatively small technical and empirical contribution given existing results on HER (Andrychowicz et al., NeurIPS 2017). However, several other reviewers, who had more engagement in the discussion, were strong supporters. Having looked at the paper myself I thought the selection of experimental problems undermined the results. Experiments are most compelling when many unaffiliated groups compete on the same benchmarks. But the basic idea of integrating HER with AlphaZero, and a reasonable attempt at this, seems to be interesting enough to warrant a poster.",0.8437309861183167
"The main idea of the paper – to try to get the “best of both worlds” when different types of random features are useful in different regimes – is very nice. However, there are a few serious issues that need to be addressed. The paper needs to be restructured on both local and global scales.","Kernel methods are among the most flexible and powerful approaches of our times. Random features (RF) provide a recent mechanism to also make them scalable due to the associated finite (and often small)-dimensional approximate feature map (in the paper referred to as linearization). The focus of the submission is the linearization of the softmax kernel (defined in (1)) while making sure that the obtained RF approximation is accurate simultaneously for the small and the large kernel values.

It would be really great to see how the insights after analysis can be used to improve performance.","This paper presents a comparison and analysis of continual learning methods for pretrained language models. The authors categorise continual learning methods into three categories, those that use cross task regularisation, those that employ some form of experience replay of previous training examples, and those that dynamically alter the network architecture for each task. Evaluation results from representative examples of these three paradigms are then presented and analysed.

Specifically, it proposes a framework to identify core and spurious features by investigating the activation maps with human supervision. Then, it produces an annotated version of the ImageNet dataset with core and spurious features, called Salient ImageNet, which is then used to empirically assess the robustness of the method against spurious training signals in comparison with current SOTA models.

The current work presents a differentiable DAG sampling which I think is novel in this field. The method is simple and clever. Timing results are very impressive. VI-DP-DAG obtains 5x-10x speedup over baselines. The proposed method does not use the augmented Lagrangian method and is more efficient than most of the current methods.,"The authors proposed an algorithm for sampling DAGs that is suited for continuous optimization. The sampling algorithm has two main steps: In the first step, a causal order over the variables is selected. In the second step, edges are sampled based on the selected order. Moreover, based on this algorithm, they proposed a method in order to learn the causal structure from the observational data. The causal structure learning algorithm is guaranteed to output a DAG at any time and it is not required any pre- or post-processing unlike previous work.

The paper is well written and I liked the theoretical part (Section 3). The ideas are very natural and nicely presented. The notion of stability will likely be picked up in future works and the authors show how to construct PE-stable layers which can be useful. Weakness: the evaluation in Section 4 is very disappointing.,"This work studies the question of increasing the expressive power of GNNs by adding positional encodings while preserving equivariance and stability to graph perturbations. Reviewers were generally positive about this work, highlighting its judicious problem setup, identifying the right notion of stability and how it should drive the design of positional encodings.

The proposed BadPre approach is a straightforward injection of backdoor in the pretraining stage.","The paper presents a backdoor attack approach against pre-trained models that may affect different downstream languages tasks with the same trigger. The paper shows that the downstream models can inherit security holes from upstream pre-trained models. The paper is on the borderline and disagreement remains after discussion and author responses. In general, the new setting introduced in the paper is interesting and well-motivated. However, the options split in how realistic the setting is (e. g., use of uncommon trigger), the evaluation of stealthiness, and the novelty of the idea. After checking the paper, I believe the ideas and insights are justifiable for an ICLR paper and they differ significantly enough from the prior work",0.8532980680465698
"The paper is nicely written, and the theoretical results are well explained. Compared to Sobolev spaces, we see the approximation of Korobov functions is free of the curse of data dimensionality.

The space seems far away from the practice of deep learning.","The authors theoretically analyze the approximation of Korobov functions by neural networks, obtaining upper and nearly matching lower bounds, for shallow and deep networks, with different activation functions. The bounds are stronger than what can be proved for the more commonly studied Sobolev functions. But Korobov functions are a natural and fairly wide class of functions. This work makes a substantial step forward in clarifying what kind of functions are especially amenable to representation by neural networks. The reviewers also appreciated the clarity of the writing.",0.8683812618255615
The ultimate goal of data augmentation is to improve the generalization power of a model.

The idea of studying geoemetry-preserving regularization while learning representations is a challenging and an important topic with a large potential impact. The experiments show that the isometric regularization and FM leads to marginal or no loss in reconstruction accuracy.

The paper is mostly clear and well written. The novelty meets the bar for a publication without rising to the level of being significant. Some parts of the experimental validation can be improved to support better the central claims – that OOD scores based on the Fisher-Rao information metrics outperform the previous state of the art.

TAdaConv can be easily plugged into any convolutional network based deep models for sequential modeling. Adequate experiments on K400 and SSV2 illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach. The language could do with a little bit of finessing in the paper. There are some instances of grammar mistakes and some unwieldy sentences.,"The authors study the problem of video classification and propose a new module which promises to increase accuracy while keeping the computational overhead low. The main idea is not to share the spatial convolution weights over different time steps, but allow some modulation based on pooled local and global frame descriptors. The resulting module can be used as a drop-in replacement for spatial convolutions in existing models and yields competitive performance on multiple video action recognition and localisation benchmarks.

"While I do find the observations interesting, I am not convinced that the method is working for the reasons that the authors have formulated. The training of uniform samples of convex combinations of anchor policies, while regularizing the anchors to be as different as possible, is effectively searching for regions in the policy space that are flat. The robust performance should come from the fact that with this region of parameters, the behavior of the system can tolerate small variations better in the first place.","The paper tackles the problem of generalizing to a new environment by learning a small set up anchor policies (even just 2 for the final approach) which span a sub-space that can be searched efficiently in a new environment.

The authors introduce a new problem of adding sparse local training to federated learning. The proposed solutions are good initial approaches backed by the empirical study and do appear to lead to some improvement in accuracy over the naive approach. The paper has following weaknesses: The main weakness of this paper is the experiments section. The results are presented only on CIFAR-10 dataset and do not consider many other datasets.,"This paper considers the problem of on-device training for federated learning. This is an important problem since, in real-world settings, the clients have limited compute and memory, and local training needs to be efficient. The paper shows that the standard sparsity based speed-up techniques that consider top-K weights/activations during forward and/or backward pass do not work well in the federated setting and proposes several solutions to mitigate this issue. The proposed solutions are demonstrated to work well on several datasets.

It appears to provide flexibility for users to obtain various preferred tradeoffs between the objectives without extra search. The basic idea is to use end-to-end RL to train the single model for all different preferences simultaneously. The technical soundness and practical performance are strong. This work's approximation guarantee depends on the ability to approximately solve several (weighted) single-objective problems,0.8504979610443115

"The paper has a lot of strengths: While the relationship between causality and adversarial robustness is often stated, this is the first paper I've seen that formally characterizes it.

Based on a causal graph of the adversarial data creation process, which describes the perceived data as a function of content and style variables, the authors identified that the spurious correlation between style and label is the main reason for adversarial examples. Based on this observation, they propose a method to learn models for which the conditional distribution of label given style and image does not vary much when attacked.

"I believe that this is a well-written paper, with solid motivation, and thoughtful care in crafting the approach. The bulk of my criticism focuses on the assumptions underlying the approach, and it’s situation relative to prior work in hierarchical, and specifically Feudal RL. Existing work in Hierarchical RL that learns separate high- and low-level policies, under similar assumptions as the Architecture-Builder setup (though possibly without the restriction of the discrete message channel) do not make this perfect transition assumption.","This paper proposes a cognitive science-inspired interaction setting between two agents, an ""architect"" and ""builder"", in which the architect must produce messages to guide the builder to achieve a task. Unlike other related settings (such as typical approaches in MARL, HRL, or HRI), the builder does not have access to the architect's reward function, and must learn to interpret the architect's messages by assuming the architect is telling it to do something sensible. At the same time, the architect determines what is ""sensible"" by building a model of the builder's behavior and planning over it. This setting is common particularly in human-agent interactions, where humans may not be able",0.8252835273742676
"The paper is a nice extension to the related works [Zarka et al (2020, 2021), Ulicny et al.(2019)].

Large scale pre-trained language models have demonstrated their effectiveness. However the large model size makes it difficult to deploy and compressing such models have drawn a lot of interest. This paper aims to compress PLMs to extremely small size mainly from the perspective of decomposition. It introduces several decomposition methods and makes a comprehensive comparison among them. The Tucker decomposition is chosen to be the final solution due to its compression ratio.,This paper reviews a number of parameter decomposition methods for BERT style contextual embedding models. The authors argue for the application of Tucker decomposition to the attention and feedforward layers of such models. Evaluation is performed for a range of models on the GLUE benchmark. Further ablation studies indicate that the distillation procedure employed is crucial for obtaining competitive results and the raw decomposition approaches are ineffective at directly approximating the original pre-trained model.

As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I",0.8438057899475098
Strengths The proposed framework and algorithm are well motivated with repeated grounding in practical considerations around problems where a ground truth model exists but is expensive to compute samples from. Weaknesses The current setup they used for BARL appears relatively computationally expensive. Only five random seeds were evaluated. The acquisition function also needs more clarification.,"In this paper, the authors introduce an exploration method for RL according to experimental design perspective via designing an acquisition function, which quantifies how much information a state-action pair would provide about the optimal solution to a Markov decision process, and the state-action that maximizes such acquisition function will be used for sampling for policy update. The empirical evidences show the proposed method is promising. Since most of the reviewers support the paper, I recommend acceptance of this submission. However, besides the questions raised by the reviewers, e. g., computation cost and planning quality from CEM, there is a major issue need to be clarified in the paper: >The algorithm designed for RL with gener",0.8373324275016785
"Bayes Augmented with Memory (BAM) takes advantage of past experience by allowing the agent to choose which past observations to remember and which to forget. While the method seems technically sound, the method still falls short of the following points: Scalability: the algorithm remembers all the data so far, which requires infinite memory in an ever-running system. So as to the computation. The algorithm will fail in an online learning environment.","The article introduces a Bayesian approach for online learning in non-stationary environments. The approach, which bears similarities with weighted likelihood estimation methods, associate a binary weight to each past observation, indicating if this observation should be including or not to compute the posterior. The weights are estimated via maximum a posteriori. The paper is well written, the approach is novel and its usefulness demonstrated on a number of different experiments. The original submission missed some relevant references that have been added in the revision. The approach has some limitations, highlighted by the reviewers: * it requires to solve a binary optimisation problem whose complexity scales exponentially with the size of the dataset; although the greedy procedure proposed by the authors",0.842564046382904
"The authors introduce a new large-scale dataset which could be of interest to the community working on data-driven solutions to full-waveform inversion.

"Authors proposes a solution to a very important problem. Paper is well written and mostly connects previous art. However, I believe some relations to needs be build with kernel literature. Authors rely on side information which they assume is a part of the training data.

"The basic idea of this work needs justifications. Authors seem to suggest that casting ""the prediction problem into an unrolled optimization process"" is better than previous approaches such as ConfGF. The number of steps is a key hyperparameter in the proposed method, which is unfortunately not studied in experiments. One of the main points of criticism is the proposed neural energy minimization framework.","All reviewers except one agreed that this paper should be accepted because of the strong author response during the rebuttal phase.

"The paper is clear and interesting, there are several issue that need more clarification as listed below.

"The proposed self-distillation framework is interesting and technically sound. Comprehensive experiments are performed, which clarify most of the critical aspects about the proposed methods. It is hard to say that the proposed method is novel, especially considering that all of the technical components used in this paper are quite common in the literature.","For pairs of pieces of text, the central idea of this paper is to combine the approaches of using bi-encoders (where a vector is formed from each text then compared), which are easily trained in an unsupervised manner, with cross-encoders (where the two texts are related at the token level), which are normally trained in a supervised manner. The chief contribution of this paper is to train a combined model (as a ""trans-encoder"") by doing co-training of both model types in an alternating cyclic self-distillation framework.

"The paper is well written, the motivation of the authors is clear, and the framework presented is easy to understand.

This paper identifies and tries to tackle an important problem in recommender systems - insufficient overlapping. The main contribution is to address the insufficient overlapping problem that causes the uncertainty of IW and DA-based methods. The motivation for the particular approach is not extremely clear. The application of existing methods from causal inference to deterministic recommendation policies is valuable.,"This paper presented a domain transportation perspective on optimizing recommender systems. The basic motivation is to view recommendation as applying some form of intervention, implying a distributional shift after the recommendation/intervention. Distribution shift brings tremendous difficulty to traditional causal inference or missing data theory perspective of recommender systems as it violates the distributional overlapping assumption: in simple terms, if the model recommends radically different set of items, there isn't much you can say about its generalization ability; on the other hand, if the model only recommends items that it already observed during training (no distribution shift at all), it would inherent all the biases which already exist in the data.

Applying the change of variables formula to augment sampling from DGNs is a novel idea. The method is interesting and theoretically well-motivated. The paper needs improvement in writing.","The paper proposes a simple method for uniform sampling from generative manifold using change of variables formula. The method works by first sampling a much larger number of samples (N) from uniform distribution in the latent space and then does sampling by replacement (using probability proportional to change in volume) to generate a smaller number of final samples (k << N) that are seen as approximately sampled from a uniform distribution from the generative manifold. Reviewers had some questions/concerns about the confusing language in the abstract and introduction around the use of the term ""uniform"" which the authors have addressed satisfactorily.

Strengths: The authors combine existing techniques to create an interesting algorithm for contextual bandits. Weaknesses: Is the direct comparison with the existing neural bandit algorithms possible? It appears that this paper has an additional assumption than the existing literature on neural bandits. There seems to be a huge gap between what is shown theoretically and what is executed in the experiments.,"This paper tackles the neural contextual bandit problem, for which existing approaches consists rely on bandit algorithms based on deep neural networks to learn reward functions. In these existing strategies, exploration takes place over the entire network parameter space, which can be inefficient for the large-size networks typically used in NTK-based approaches. In this work, the authors address this by building on an existing technique of shallow exploration, which consists in exploring over the final layer of the network only, allowing to decouple the deep neural network feature representation learning from most of the exploration of the network parameters. More specifically, they propose a simple and effective UCB-based strategy using this shallow exploration scheme, for which",0.8404845595359802
"The method is more efficient than existing approaches that require retraining for different confidence levels. PI3NN outperforms the baselines considered in their experiments.

This paper presents a learnable similarity function that adaptively adjusts the weights of the similarity between one sample and the samples of some class. The experimental results of the proposed algorithm outperform that of the other comparable clustering algorithms. It could add more value to this paper if the authors provide more examples showing why the derived discriminative similarity is better than conventional similarities.,"The authors provide a framework for unsupervised clarification based on minimizing a between-cluster discriminative similarity. It is more flexible than existing methods whose kernel similarity implicitly assumes uniform weights, and the authors connect to ideas such as max-margin and weighted kernel approaches. This yields a clustering algorithm naturally that alternates between updating class labels and similarity weights. Moreover the reviewers (and I) appreciate the analysis of generalization error through Rademacher complexity arguments and detailed author responses. I might add while the paper draws connections to weighted kernel methods and have since added references to sparse subspace clustering etc, there is recent interest in using similar arguments to derive error bounds and uniform concentration results",0.8548979759216309

Pruning-aware training is interesting and has a lot of potential. The motivation for K-sparse constraint set is not clear. More clarity is required on how the authors chose to use such a constraint set. It is intriguing that even with such a restrictive update the final weights are competitive to SGD based training.,"This work considers one-shot pruning in deep neural networks. The main departure from previous work is to consider stochastic Frank-Wolfe. The reported results are convincing although a number of baselines were missing from the initial submission. The authors provide a balanced account of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. The authors adequately addressed the concerns of the reviewers. For instance they ran additional experiments to compare to missing pruning baselines.

There were some concerns such as the effect of progressive distillation and the overhead of distilling the diffusion model but the authors provided a satisfactory response and backed it",0.8554293513298035
Strengths: This paper provides a principled way to study the effect of example selection on convergence of SGD. Weakness: The proposed QMC-based algorithm is an extension of random reshuffling to the scenario of data augmentation. Main concern that I have is that all rates for RR and SO seem to be strictly worse than the rate of standard gradient descent.,"This paper studies the dependency of SGD convergence on order of examples. The main observation of the paper is: if the averages of consecutive stochastic gradients converge faster to the full gradient, then the SGD with the corresponding sampling strategy will have a faster convergence rate. For different sampling strategies, sampling with replacement has slower convergence in stochastic gradient, where sampling without replacement can converge faster. The paper also proposes two new algorithms that can improve convergence rates in some interesting settings. The reviewers find the analysis clean and the new algorithms are interesting. There is some concern on the dependency on n or d for the faster rate, which should be discussed more clearly in the final version of the",0.8529596924781799
The connection between calibration and generalization is novel. The theoretical results are sound. Paper is well written and easy to follow. Weaknesses: The data for DiffOrder and Diff Init deviates from the y=x curve more than the other two cases where a fresh dataset is used.,"This article introduces an interesting variant of the work of Nakkiran & Bansal (2020). It shows empirically that the test error of deep models can be approximated from the disagreement on the unlabelled test data between two different trainings on the same data. The authors then show theoretically that a calibration property can explain such behaviour, and they report experiments showing that the relationship does exist in practical situations. All reviewers agree on the practical and theoretical value of the article, which is very well organised and written. The ideas developed here are likely to lead to further work in the future, and they clearly deserve to be published at ICLR. I agree with one of the reviewers",0.8367225527763367
"The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The experiments clearly demonstrate that GPM improves exploration over naive baselines.

The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed PBRL is well motivated and is backed by theoretical results in a linear MDP setting. The method outperforms various offline RL algorithms including model-based algorithms and uncertainty-aware methods. The paper provides informative ablation studies comparing various regularizations and analyzing the effects of hyperparameters.,"This paper makes significant advances in offline reinforcement learning by proposing a new approach of being pessimistic to deal with uncertainties in the offline data. The proposed approach uses bootstrapped Q-functions to quantify the uncertainty, which by itself is not new, and introduces additional data based on the pseudo-target that is penalized by the uncertainty quantification. The use of such additional data is the first of a kind, and the paper provides theoretical support for the case of linear MDP and empirical support with the D4RL benchmark.

Its key idea is to generate subgraphs from the original graph, then encode the subgraphs into the message passing process of GNN. The proposed method is proven to be strictly more powerful than 1-WL. The authors also quantize how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture can affect the architecture’s expressive power.

The main weakness of the proposed approach is that it takes the form of combining multiple existing techniques into one coherent approach. Strengths: The idea is natural and the explanation is clear. Cons: It is yet not clear on which occasion it is a better idea to use a sequential method that will only be used once to do inference.,"The authors propose a well-presented approach to likelihood-free inference. The reviewers are all in alignment in recommending this paper for acceptance.

"This paper proposes a good idea to solve the trilemma in generative learning. It would accelerate the sampling in denoising diffusion models by using conditional GANs. The approach is relatively simple and provides good results. The results on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and LSUN Churches are competitive with state-of-the-art methods.","The paper modifies DPMs by replacing the denoising L2 losses with GANs to learn the iterative denoising process. This leads to excellent results using a small number of refinement steps. In some sense, this also takes away one of the key advantages of DPMs over GANs, which is DPMs minimize a well-defined objective function. Nevertheless, the results are convincing, but not spectacular. I am not convinced that we should continue to report training FID on CIFAR-10.

"This is a very well written and very insightful work. The writing is flawless, the structure is very clear and the presentation of ideas unfolds naturally. The contributions are significant, their evaluation is convincing, both in the method and in the results. I identify two weaknesses. Some evaluation aspects are omitted, and I question their effect on the mechanism of InFeR.","The paper analyzes the learning behavior of deep networks inside RL algorithms, and proposes an interesting hypothesis: that many of the observed difficulties in deep RL methods stem from _capacity loss_ of the trained network (that is, the network loses the ability to adapt quickly to fit new functions). As the paper points out, some of these difficulties have popularly been attributed to other causes (such as difficulties in exploration) or to less-specific causes (such as reward sparsity: the paper proposes that capacity loss mediates observed problems due to sparsity). The paper investigates its hypothesis two ways: first by attempting to measure how capacity varies over time during training of existing deep RL methods, and second",0.8311669826507568
The paper is very well-written and easy to follow. It targets the SFDA setting but with a different type of domain shift to the common setting. It achieves promising results on several types of datasets in terms of accuracy and calibration compared to the SOTA. The analysis for the intuition and assumption of the proposed algorithm is not presented.,"The paper aims to solve the source-free domain adaptation, specifically on measurement shift.

Two reviewers voted strong accept, with a third raising several concerns. The largest concern was the lack of comparison to",0.8339623212814331
The performance of the proposed algorithm can vary heavily on the diversity of tasks. Different distance metrics other than Grassmann should be considered to see whether it leads to consistent performance. Learning new tasks on low-rank filter subspace seems interesting and novel for solving continual learning problems. The proposed method achieves good performance on the benchmark dataset.,"The authors propose a memory-based continual learning method that decomposes the models' parameters and that shares a large number of the decomposed parameters across tasks. In other words, only a small number of parameters are task-specific and the memory usage of storing models from previous tasks is hence a fraction of the memory usage of previous approaches. The authors take advantage of their method to propose specific ensembling approaches and demonstrate the strong performance of their methods using several datasets. In the rebuttal, the authors were very reactive and provided many useful additional results during including a comparison of the computational cost of their method vs. others, results using two new datasets (CUBS & Flowers), and additional results",0.8518461585044861
"The paper introduces the algorithm well and the order of information seems nice. The authors argue that ""Single-Task Learning... can be regarded as the strongest expansion-based method"" I disagree that STL is the strongest baseline, as there is no potential for forward or backward transfer between tasks with STL. I still expect RGO to significantly outperform baselines.","This paper proposes an innovative method for continual learning that modifies the direction of gradients on a new task to minimise forgetting on previous tasks without data replay. The method is mathematically rigorous with a strong theoretical analysis and excellent empirical results across multiple continual learning benchmarks. It is a clear accept. There was good discussion between the reviewers and authors that addressed a number of minor issues, including clarifying that the method has the same computational complexity as backpropagation. The authors are encouraged to make sure that these points are addressed in the final version of the paper.",0.847533106803894
