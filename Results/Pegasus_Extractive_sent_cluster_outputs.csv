The method is compared to a variety of existing methods on Mujoco problems in “episodic reward” settings, where the reward is zero except for the final step of the episode, where it is the sum of rewards from the original task.

It seems that the proposed setting is just a meta learning setting but not a multi-task learning setting. The knowledge graph stated in this paper is just a graph.","The paper describes a novel learning scenario where there are many related tasks, some seen at test time, and some seen only at training time, where additionally the task labels can be hidden or present. This approach generalizes both a ""relational setting"" (where auxiliary task labels could be used as features) and a ""meta setting"" (where new tasks need to be solved in a zero-shot setting using data from related tasks only). The idea behind the method is to do MTL with a common representation and a set of task-specific heads, and build a graph where (1) tasks are nodes associated with the parameters of their task-specific ""heads"" and (2) edges link examples to tasks",0.8469570279121399,0.41015231112639106
This paper proposes an approach to transformer design that combines the transformer architecture with GRUs to. The proposed approach seems like a novel combination of existing methods with the advantage of requiring less prior knowledge and higher sample efficiency. This is much better done in section 2. Experiments are comprehensive and the ablation study is appreciated. A minor gripe is the use of Y for input and X for output of the transformer.,"This paper introduces a new transformer architecture for representation learning in RL. The key ingredients of the proposed architectures are a novel combination of existing methods: (1) the use of LSTMs to reduce the need for large transformers and (2) a contrastive learning procedure that doesn't require human data augmentation. The resulting approach requires less prior knowledge and provides higher sample efficiency. The paper is convincing, with comprehensive experiments on multiple challenging and well-known benchmarks and an ablation study. The reviewers did expressed concerns that parts of the paper are a very difficult read and could use improvement, especially those relying on substantial external background.

"This paper shows that strong personalized models emerge from the local training step of generic FL algorithms, and show that class-balanced objectives are effective for improving the generic FL performance. The paper proposes Federated Robust Decoupling (FED-ROD) to excel on both generic FL and personalized FL.","This manuscript proposes and analyses can approach to address the centralized and personalized tasks in federated learning jointly. Existing work has tackled this issue by developing separate tasks. Instead, this manuscript proposes a shared architecture that aims to optimize centralized and personalized models. One observation motivating this work is that local models trained during federated learning effectively optimize local task performance. The resulting approach results well when label shifts primarily drive the client variability. Here, the centralized components are trained to optimize a balanced risk, while the local components are trained to optimize the standard empirical risk. Reviewers agree that the manuscript is well-written and appropriately addresses the timely issue posed.

"The paper proposes an EC-based pre-training approach for image-captioning and language modeling tasks. The reviewers were concerned about the experimental design, the strength of the conclusions, and how the authors are choosing to interpret them. The idea of pretraining on emergent corpora neatly brings together new ideas about transfer learning and modern studies of emergent communication. I imagine it will inspire plenty of follow-up work, exploring how different aspects of the EC corpus do or do not result in better transfer. This language persists throughout, and a reader not aware of Li's work would easily go through most of the paper believing that this paradigm","This paper explores ways in which *emergent communication* (EC) methods from representation learning can be evaluated extrinsically, by hooking them into downstream NLP tasks.
