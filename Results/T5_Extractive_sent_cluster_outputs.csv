To this end, the authors introduce an intrinsic reward inspired by the exploration bonus of LinUCB. This novel exploration method called anti-concentrated confidence bounds (ACB) provably approximates the elliptical exploration bonus of LinUCB by using an ensemble of least-squares regressors. This allows ACB to bypass costly covariance matrix inversion, which can be problematic for high-dimensional problems (hence allowing it to be used in large state spaces). Empirical experiments show that ACB enjoys near-optimal performance in linear stochastic bandits. However, experiments on Atari benchmark fail to show any practical advantage of ACB over current methods, neither computation nor performance-wise. That being said, the proposed ACB approach is theoretically transparent, which contributes to advancing our theoretical understanding of usable intrinsic rewards in deep RL and can inform theoretically motivated directions for improvement and further research, while being on par with SOTA. I believe that this makes the contribution of this work strong enough for acceptance.",0.7966458201408386,0.23838385685275382

The Authors first draw attention to the fact that using recalculated moments boosts performance and reduces forgetting, which serves as an argument that at least partially BN contributes to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Given that BN remains quite important in certain application areas such as vision, it is a strong motivation for the paper. The experiments are thorough and clearly show that CN is a practically relevant alternative to BN in continual learning. One weakness of the paper is that the method is poorly motivated, and relatedly, it has quite limited novelty. CN combines the strengths and weaknesses of BN and GN. Hence, it is not clear why it outperforms both, given that it still has the issue of BN that normalization statistics might become outdated. This is one of the weaknesses pointed out by 9jXz who recommended rejecting the paper. It would be also nice to compare to Mode Normalization /forum?id=HyN-M2Rctm. Other papers have suggested changing normalization for sequential learning. Changing batch normalization (to batch renormalization) was investigated in [1] in the context of continual learning.

In their paper, the authors develop an initial benchmark for the task along with a set of baselines and provide empirical studies. The initial reviews were quite mixed. The reviewers seem to agree this work studies an interesting and fairly novel direction for continual learning of language.

Overall, the reviewers found the idea to be novel and interesting and I agree. They also found the relation to the noise2noise objective worth highlighting.

The paper proposes novel information-theoretic criteria that selects samples that captures surprise (samples that are most informative) and learnability (to avoid outliers).

There is consensus among the reviewers that the paper should be accepted: - This paper does contribute solidly to a timely topic of theoretical understanding of sparisty recovery with deep unroling. - The original version had very limited experiments and only synthetic ones, which raised concerns about whether the setting is motivated and whether the algorithm works on actual real data. The revision fixed that to an extent with some experiments on real data. Yet, there are still some concerns that we suggest to be tackled for the final version: - The capacity analysis is carried out inside a strongly convex regime while the algorithm is advocated for nonconvex sparsity recovery (see, e. g., the Discussion at the end of Section 2.1 ); - The analysis is relatively loosely connected to the adopted fist-order optimization procedure; - While the depth of network plays a role in the upper bound of Equation (15), its real impact on generalization gap looks quite limited. The above are just suggestions to be looked more carefully, but there are not necessary. The current consensus is that the paper deserves publication. Best AC",0.7723811268806458,0.2565121443735229

The goal is to achieve common corruption robustness as well as a non-trivial level of adversarial robustness. The authors claim state-of-the-art-performance on CIFAR10-C. Most reviewers had initial concerns which the authors could clarify in most cases. Finally, all reviewers argue for acceptance. Strengths: - no pre-defined corruption model necessary - extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet with SOTA results - all reviewers agree that this paper would be valuable as a future reference Weaknesses: - the theoretical part is in my point of view rather misleading and should be completely rewritten as the authors lack here rigor concerning the setting they are working in (as also Reviewer 31sh criticizes). In particular the corruptions are not just a covariate shift (p(y|x) is invariant, only p(x) changes) as the corruptions mix the conditional distributions of different points. Thus under the given assumptions (which should be summarized at one point rather than being scattered over the text) the Bayes optimal classifer is invariant but not the Bayes optimal predictive probability distribution (which is clearly important for assessing uncertainty of the prediction). However, when training with the cross-entropy loss we are estimating the predictive probability distribution and thus the given statement about convergence of the risks makes no sense for me and the optimal parameters of the classifier need not be equal even if their classifications agree everywhere. Thus the required changes to fix this theoretical part go significantly beyond what the authors suggest in their rebuttal. - the improvements over AugMix+DeepAugment (7.83 mCE vs 7.99 mCE) are negligible and most likely not statistically significant While AdA has significantly higher adversarial robustness than AugMix+DeepAugment, it remains unclear if using AugMix+DeepAugment together with adversarial training for l_2 as done in [3] Kireev, Klim, Maksym Andriushchenko, and Nicolas Flammarion.

The theoretical part as written currently is misleading as discussed above - the authors have to make it completely rigorous (including proofs, formal statements/defininitions etc) or get rid of it. Minor weak points: - According to the leaderboard of RobustBench the SOTA for CIFAR10-C is by now taken by the NeurIPS 2021 paper Diffenderfer et al, A Winning Hand: Compressing Deep Networks Can Improve Out-Of-Distribution Robustness which achieves 96.56% standard accuracy and 92.78% mCE. This is 1.64% and 0.61% better than in the present paper and needs to be discussed as prior work. - for the adversarial robustness evaluation regarding ""AutoAttack & MultiTargeted"" you refer to Gowal et al (2020) but the robustness evaluation has to be properly discussed in this paper",0.8097953796386719,0.3468088989815952

Cons: - Proposal is a straightforward combination of two methods, and therefore technical contribution is marginal. - The threat model is easy (surrogate can be trained on the same datasets and use the same loss function) and questionable. Most of the experimental evidence shows that the research for this threat model is almost saturated (and the problem seems almost solved). This paper got a borderline score with reviewer's concerns above. I agree with the authors that the simplest method is best among those performing similarly, but the threat setting considered might be not very realistic as the authors admitted. I see the proposed method a kind of egg of Columbus in a negative sense. Namely, the authors found a shortcut to win a game that was created and adopted by the community. Perhaps this paper would give an impact on the small community and would make the community change the game. But to give an impact to a general audience, the authors should convince that there are some situations where the analyzed thread model is realistic and therefore the proposed method is really useful. Or, the authors could adjust the thread model to be more realistic. Serious discussion on the thread model would be a big plus to the marginal technical contributions.

For context, the motivation behind many of these methods is that by occluding various parts of the image, one can ask counterfactuals such as ""what would the model have predicted if this object were not present in the image""? However, the authors note that when occluding pixels, classifiers are still functions of the occlusions themselves, so this process may introduce a bias as a result. This is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where a convolutional architecture classifies various occluded images as ""jigsaw"" or ""crossword puzzle"", arguably due to the fact that scattered patch based occlusions resemble crossword puzzles. The authors then demonstrate that ViT models can be modified in a way to ask the above counter-factual in a more principled manner---namely by dropping image tokens within the transformer model, the resulting function doesn't take any occluded pixels as input. Reviewers all found the analysis quite insightful, and did not find any significant flaws in the experiments. During the rebuttal, the authors added numerous experiments to address concerns raised by reviewers regarding lack of datasets for which the method was run on.

I'm sympathetic to this style of research (particularly in today's neural network research), although the reviewers raise a primary concern about whether the choices leading to the proposal are justified. In particular, two Reviewers argue that there are no clear ablations compared to alternative simpler approaches, and so the approach of selecting a Set Transformer is rather arbitrary. My perspective is that theory provides one sufficient but not necessary angle to do this, and I do find the authors' replies to the two reviewers convincing.

The paper is well-structured and describes concisely and clearly the work done.,"In this paper, a new method is proposed to discover diverse policies solving a given task. The key ideas are to (1) learn one policy at a time, with each new policy trying to be different enough from the previous ones, and (2) switch between two rewards on a per-trajectory basis: the ""normal"" reward on trajectories that are unlikely enough under previoiusly discovered policies, and a ""diversity-inducing"" reward on trajectories that are too likely (so as to push the policy being learned away from the previous ones). The main benefit of this switching mechanism is to ensure that the new policy will be optimal, because the reward signal isn't ""diluted"" by the diversity-inducing signal as long as the policy stays far away from the previous ones. After the discussion period, most reviewers clearly recommended acceptance of the paper. One reviewer remained on the ""reject"" side though, especially due to an unconvincing theoretical analysis of the method, in spite of several back and forth with authors. I also had my own concerns regarding that part after reading the paper, and further discussions with authors eventualy led to a significant rewrite of the corresponding theorems and proofs. I believe the final version (shared in comments by authors after the dealine for paper revisions) to at least be technically correct, though the relevance of the theory w. r. t. practical usage of the method is still not entirely convincing (e. g., assumptions regarding the number of distinct global optima, and the need for positive rewards). That being said, in spite of these concerns regarding the practical significance of the theoretical analysis, I believe the paper has a strong enough empirical validation, and the method is (1) simple, (2) intuitively reasonable, (3) original due to the trajectory-switching mechanism, which makes me recommend acceptance.",0.7841861844062805,0.41188334533944726

True spokesman: a spokesman for a spokesman said that he would not be contacted for comment.,"This paper introduces a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST) that learns latent subword representations from characters. GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network. The resulting model was tested on GLUE, and several cross-lingual tasks. The performance is competitive with ByteT5 and often similar to subword models while being more efficient in FLOPs and RAM. Reviewers are mixed on this. The negative reviewer points to how this not being a real tokenizer and does not produce a tokenization, that experiments that use the base model do not address bigger scales, and that there is a lack of code which is important for this kind of work, and the resulting accuracy gains are not significant and the method being not interpretable. The positive reviewers like the extensive experiments, the efficiency improvements and flexibility / simplicity of the GBST module.

The approach is applicable when the approximate posterior is obtained via (stochastic gradient) MCMC methods. Unlearning is done by shifting the approximate true posterior by some value delta, which is found via optimisation with an influence function. The approach is novel, tackles an important problem and is mathematically sound. Reviewers have highlighted some of its limitations. In particular, the modified posterior is obtained by translating the original posterior, without changing its shape; many aspects of the data may therefore not be forgotten. The authors have partially addressed this concern in their response and provided additional experiments. Although there is still disagreement amongst reviewers, I recommend acceptance. A Minor comment: I would not present MCMC merely as a ""machine learning algorithm"" (p.1), nor as a ""sampling based Bayesian inference method"" (p.1 and p.2). MCMC is a generic approach to approximate high-dimensional integrals and obtain samples approximately sampled from some target distribution, dating back from the work of Metropolis (1953) and Hastings (1970).

The unrolled version includes a soft-thresholding update, in which the thresholding parameter and one of the weight matrices is learned from data, with a least squares dictionary update, in which the step size is learned from data. The paper provides experimental results showing that this LPALM algorithm is less sensitive to the choice of hyper parameters (since step sizes, etc. are learned from data), and to the choice of the initial dictionary (perhaps since the W matrices are learned from similar examples). It also improves over PALM on experimental data from an astronomy problem. Reviewers expressed appreciation for the paper’s experimental results, and detailed investigation of the parameterization of unrolled PALM. They also highlighted some issues in the initial submission's exposition -- in particular, the setting of the problem (what kind of training data is available, what is the relationship between the mixing matrices A at training and at test time), and a clearer explanation of why it makes sense to learn fixed matrices W^{(k)} which do not depend on A (given that A may change at test time).

The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/modified to other (potentially more efficient) bandit strategies.

The main idea is not to share the spatial convolution weights over different time steps, but allow some modulation based on pooled local and global frame descriptors. The resulting module can be used as a drop-in replacement for spatial convolutions in existing models and yields competitive performance on multiple video action recognition and localisation benchmarks. The reviewers appreciated this challenging setting and the simplicity of the main idea. They found that the paper was clearly written, well organised, and easy to follow. The reviewers raised some issues in connections with related work and the empirical evaluation which were successfully resolved during the discussion phase. Given that computational efficiency remains as one of the most challenging topics in video understanding, I believe that this technique will be relevant for the larger video understanding community.

i. The paper has following strengths: 1.Strengths: The authors introduce a new problem of adding sparse local training to federated learning. 2.Weaknesses: The empirical study appears a bit limited as it considers only a single dataset (CIFAR10) and a single model architecture (ResNet18).,"This paper considers the problem of on-device training for federated learning. This is an important problem since, in real-world settings, the clients have limited compute and memory, and local training needs to be efficient. The paper shows that the standard sparsity based speed-up techniques that consider top-K weights/activations during forward and/or backward pass do not work well in the federated setting and proposes several solutions to mitigate this issue. The proposed solutions are demonstrated to work well on several datasets. In their initial assessment, given that this is largely an empirical insights driven paper, the reviewers mainly expressed concerns about the experimental evaluation (e. g., only one dataset CIFAR10 and one architecture ResNet18) and lack of more baselines (e. g., Federated Dropout). The authors responded in detail to the reviews and also conducted additional experiments and the reviewers and authors engaged in discussion. As the discussion converged, the reviewers agreed that the revised manuscript addresses their key concerns and their assessment, on an average, are now learning largely towards a borderline accept. I also read the reviews, the discussion, and read the paper. I think the paper is a good initial attempt at providing a general approach to enable on-device federated learning when the clients are lightweight devices (e. g. edge devices). Even though the study is somewhat preliminary, the current manuscript, after the revision during the discussion phase, is significantly improved version of the original submission and does address the key concerns from the reviewers. Overall, I would rate the paper for a borderline acceptance.",0.8466288447380066,0.47696025023857747

Since the number of mixture components rapidly increases from layer to layer (after convolution) and common activation functions such as ReLU do not preserve the Gaussian Mixtures (GM), the paper proposes a fitting stage that fits a GM to the output of the transfer function and uses a heuristic to reduce the number of mixture components. Experiments are presented on MNIST (2d) and ModelNet10 (3D), which show competitive performance compared to other approaches such as classic CNNs, PointNet and PontNet++ methods. There is somewhat an overall consensus on the novelty of the proposed approach and its potential to pave the way for further research. There were, however, several issues raised by the reviewers in terms of clarity, memory footprint and computational cost that limits the applicability of the method to more complex datasets. While the authors expanded on the dense fitting in their comments and in the revised version of the paper, it still remains unclear the role of the negative weights, as the dense fitting stage seems to constrain all the weights to be positive. In terms of memory footprint, the authors refer to the theoretical footprint and their implementation does not match this. Finally, it is acknowledged by the authors that the computational cost is a limitation that hinders the method from achieving competitive performance in more complex tasks.",0.795474112033844,0.09562337910109717

Typically, only the score function estimator is provided with the conditioning signal, and the prior is an unconditional standard Gaussian distribution. It is shown that making the prior conditional improves results on speech generation tasks. Several reviewers initially recommended rejection, but after extensive discussion and interaction with the authors, all reviewers have given this work a ""borderline accept"" rating. Criticisms included that the idea is too simple or obvious to warrant an ICLR paper. I am inclined to disagree: simple ideas that work are often the ones that persist and see rapid adoption (dropout regularisation is my favourite example). Like the authors, I believe simplicity is an advantage in this respect, rather than a disadvantage. Of course, simple ideas do require extensive and convincing empirical validation to be worth publishing at ICLR. After the authors' updates, I believe the work meets this bar. Another issue raised by several reviewers is the limited theoretical justification for the approach. However, combined with the simplicity of the method, I believe the empirical results of the revised version sufficiently justify the approach on their own. Nevertheless, I would recommend that the authors consider further how they could address this issue in the final version of their manuscript, as they have already begun to do during the discussion phase. Another way to strengthen the paper further would be to demonstrate how the generic approach can be applied in a different domain (e. g. conditional image generation), but I do not consider this addition necessary for the work to warrant publication.

The main idea is to encourage higher inner-product between gradients from different domains. Instead of adding an explicit regularizer to encourage this, authors propose an optimization algorithm called Fish which implicitly encourages higher inner-product between gradients of different domains.

Reviewers all found the proposed algorithm novel and expressed that the contributions of the paper in terms of improving domain generalization is significant. A major issue that came up during the discussion period was that we realized that the presented results on WILDS benchmark are misleading. In particular, the following statements in the manuscript are false because on ""CivilComments"" and ""Amazon"", Fish utilizes a BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018). However, other methods at WILDS benchmark use DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019): - Section 4.2: ""For hyper-parameters including learning rate, batch size, choice of optimizer and model architecture, we follow the exact configuration as reported in the WILDS benchmark. Importantly, we also use the same model selection strategy used in WILDS to ensure a fair comparison."" - Appendix C2: ""Results: We compare results to the baselines used in the WILDS benchmark over 3 random seed runs in Table 10. All models are trained using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)."" Authors explained that the mismatch is because at the time they evaluated their model, an earlier version of WILDS benchmark was available but they later updated other methods' results on a newer version of WILDS benchmark. Of course, I do not think that this explanation makes the misleading statements OK. Authors promised to do the following for the camera-ready version to make sure it is not misleading: - Using ""Worst-U/R Pearson r"" as the comparison measure for ""PovertyMap"" - Submitting their method to WILDS benchmark making sure everything matches the baselines and then reporting the results on ""Amazon"" and ""CivilComments"" datasets.

The authors identify the problem that gradient based training on the netgative log likelihood (NLL) may result in suboptimal solutions where a high predicted variance compensates for the predicted mean being far from the true mean. To solve this problem, the authors suggest to adjust the log likelihood objective by weighting the log likelihood of each single data point by the corresponding beta-exponentiated variance estimate. This adjusted objective is referred to as beta-NLL. All reviewers agreed that the identified problem and the proposed solution are interesting, that the paper is well written and organized, and that the contributions are significant and somewhat new. The main criticism was on the side of the empirical evaluation. It was criticized that the empirical analysis did not compare the proposed method to other approaches to solving the same problem, that the identified problem and the proposed method should be also analyzed on high-dimensional data, that the results on the synthetic experiments could be improved by investigating more than a single run and by incorporating the the MSE in corresponding Figure 1, and that standard errors were not reported. Based on the reviews the authors added several new experiments and investigations in the revised version of their manuscript to improve their empirical analysis: 1) new experiments on high-dimensional data sets were conducted applying variational autoencoders on MNIST and Fashion MNIST and performing Depth-map prediction from images on the NYUv2 dataset. 2) For comparison several baseline methods were added to the experiments on the UCI and the dynamics datasets. 3) Three more UCI datasets (carbon, superconductivity, wine-white) were included in the empirical analysis. 4) An evaluation of calibration of predictive variance for the heteroscedastic sine dataset was added. 5) Several more repetitions of the experiment represented in Figure 1 were conducted.

The work follows the line of research in which model size is reduced by decomposing the matrices in the model into smaller factors. Two-step approaches apply SVD and then fine-tuned the model on task specific data. The present work makes the observation that after the first step (the SVD compression) the model can dramatically lose its performance, due to the mismatched optimization objectives between the low-rank approximation and the target task. The work provides evidence backing this claim. The paper proposes to address this problem by weighting the importance of parameters for the factorization according to the Fisher information. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method can achieve better results than variants that use truncated SVD of the weight matrices. The paper is well written and easy to read. The method is simple and effective and can be applied to in a wide range of settings. The authors provided a thorough response which clarified several points. This led Reviewer Kuwu to increase the score to 6.

False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False : False,"This paper proposes a cognitive science-inspired interaction setting between two agents, an ""architect"" and ""builder"", in which the architect must produce messages to guide the builder to achieve a task. Unlike other related settings (such as typical approaches in MARL, HRL, or HRI), the builder does not have access to the architect's reward function, and must learn to interpret the architect's messages by assuming the architect is telling it to do something sensible. At the same time, the architect determines what is ""sensible"" by building a model of the builder's behavior and planning over it. This setting is common particularly in human-agent interactions, where humans may not be able to either (1) accurately communicate a scalar reward or (2) provide demonstrations, but can still provide information that the agent ought to be able to learn from. The paper demonstrates that the learned communication protocol generalizes well to new settings. While this paper generated a lot of discussion, the reviewers did not come to a consensus on whether the paper should be accepted or rejected, with those in favor of the paper maintaining it should be accepted and those not in favor maintaining that it needs work. I have therefore done a particularly close read of both the paper and the discussion in order to weigh the pros and cons brought up by the reviewers. The positive reviews clearly indicate that this work is insightful and of interest to researchers in the ICLR community (in fact, all reviewers mentioned they found the work interesting and well-written). In particular, Reviewer hMeT wrote: ""I am positive about this framework as it presents a better model for multi-agent communication, especially enriching the communication among agents over the fixed, restricted reward-based communication protocol in traditional RL."" I am inclined to agree with this assessment and find the communication setting studied in this paper to be much more ecologically valid for human-agent interaction settings than having humans communicate scalar rewards or provide demonstrations: humans are typically poor at the former and may not have the same embodiment to achieve the latter. The negative reviews focused on a few cons: (1) the assumption that the architect has access to a ground-truth environment model, (2) confusion about differences from other related fields (e. g. feudal RL, MARL), and (3) lack of analysis of the communication protocol. I have considered these points, but do not feel any of them are fatal flaws: (1) From the perspective of human-agent interaction, I think it is very reasonable to assume that a human architect would have a good model of the world and would be generally proficient at solving tasks in the world. Making this approach work in the setting where the architect is *also* learning how the world works seems squarely in the domain of future work. (2) The authors have done an extensive job of clarifying the differences between these related areas, and as discussed above, other reviewers found the way in which AGP is different to be insightful and ecologically valid. (3) This is potentially the most serious con: as the discussion with Reviewer BHGy brought up, the learned communication protocol may just be a simple mapping between messages and environment interactions. After further discussion in which the authors argued that learning a simple mapping is not a problem---the main question is how to even induce such a mapping in the first place---the reviewer acknowledged that this is not a fatal flaw but that makes the results somewhat less interesting. In summary, the positive reviews highlighted the interestingness and insightful nature of the questions studied in this paper and have convinced me that this paper will be of interest to the ICLR community as it has provides a new perspective on the problem of agent-agent interaction (particularly for the special case of human-agent interaction). The negative reviews did highlight a few limitations of the paper, but I expect these can be addressed by future work and do not feel they outweigh the interestingness of the problem. In light of this, I recommend acceptance as a poster. Suggestion for the authors: I found the discussion with Reviewer BHGy to be particularly insightful and helpful in understanding the aims of the paper. I would encourage you to incorporate some of this into the camera-ready version of the paper, and perhaps to lean more heavily on the special case of human-agent interaction as motivation of this work (as also hinted at by Reviewer hMeT).",0.7069017291069031,0.06888798725875941

A bandit approach (UCB) is used to select which cluster to sample parents from. The QD algorithm can be evaluated on its own, outside of the RL context, and if so it should be compared to the several approaches to niching and other standard diversity preservation approaches in evolutionary computation that rely on clustering. (And the authors should make an effort to connect to the niching literature in particular.) However, the use of the algorithm for RL makes it possible to use behavioral features as the space in which to cluster, separating it from standard diversity preservation methods. The resulting algorithm is relatively simple and the empirical results are good.

The authors argue for the application of Tucker decomposition to the attention and feedforward layers of such models. Evaluation is performed for a range of models on the GLUE benchmark. Further ablation studies indicate that the distillation procedure employed is crucial for obtaining competitive results and the raw decomposition approaches are ineffective at directly approximating the original pre-trained model. Strengths: The reviewers generally agree that the methods explored and results presented in this paper are interesting and could be of use to those deploying large embedding models. The authors review a range of possible decomposition methods and use this to motivate their approach. The resulting levels compression are high while maintaining good performance, while the ablation study clearly shows the contribution of the various steps of the training pipeline. Weaknesses: The main weakness identified by the reviewers is the incremental nature of this work in comparison to previous works applying various decomposition and compression techniques to neural networks. They also highlight that many of the techniques discussed early in the paper are not compared in the evaluation. The authors have effectively responded to this issue by providing further comparisons and justification for their modelling choices (e. g. not compressing the embedding layers). Overall, despite the incremental nature of this work, I believe that there are enough though provoking ideas and results presented to warrant publication. Interestingly, as the authors emphasise in their response, the ablation study highlights that this work is not really about approximating the original models weights, as all of the work appears to be being done by the distillation procedure in concert with the choice weight decomposition.

The 1.4x speedup it achieves over PipeDream-2BW is impressive. In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the problem WPipe tries to tackle is important and that the approach is novel and interesting. But there was significant disagreement among the reviewers as to score. A reviewer expressed concern about the work being incremental and difficult to follow.

"""Strengths: I think the work is solving an important problem.. I did actually implement the Chakrabati method for GNNs.. Strengths: I think the work is solving an important problem.. I think the paper is solving an important problem.. I think the work is solving an important problem..","There are numerous known methods for memory reduction used in CNNs. This paper takes two such---quantization (Q) and random projection (RP)---and applies them to GNNs. This is a novelty, but I agree with the reviewers: on its own this novelty would not be ""surprising"" enough to report at ICLR. The paper further goes to show empirically that these methods, when applied to a reasonable set of datasets, do indeed produce their predicted memory reductions (unsurprising) with a small ( ≈0.5% ) drop in accuracy (surprising, in the sense of not being something one could predict without doing the experiment). All of the above is in one sense ""just engineering"", with only a small inventive step. Any real-world deployment of GNNs would, if an army of engineers were available, naturally implement quantization and RP in order to see what kind of improvements they might make. This would be just two more hyperparameters (R,B) to add to the sweep, and the deployment would vary them until the required accuracy was achieved in the minimum time (OOM is a red herring - one would vary batch size, other compression, or ship values to CPU in order to make progress). However, ""simply adding two more hyperparameters"" is a significant increase in the deployment burden, which is where the paper's third contribution comes in: the theoretical analysis of the effects of the two processes, with straightforward but nonobvious calculations of the effect on gradient variance of the two processes, and, usefully, their interaction. The value of this theory is twofold: first, it gives us new tools to analyse such processes; and second, it allows us to be much more judicious in the selection of these hyperparameters. In all, the reviewers' objection of no great novelty in porting ideas from CNN to GNN is sustained; but the authors' claim as to the value of the theory is sustained, and no reviewer provides prior art to dispute the novelty of the theory calculations. The revised paper has already expanded the key sections in Appendix E, and added welcome experiments which strengthen the paper. I would encourage a final copy (and certainly the poster presentation) to emphasize some of the insights over the raw experimental numbers. As the authors hint, those numbers are subject to vagaries of what PyTorch happens to implement, while the underlying analyses are a little longer lasting. Some other comments: A lot of discussion time was spent on the question of whether 0.5% is negligible. This is entirely application dependent, and is part of the hyperparameter/architecture tuning process. - the extra time overhead of swapping ""can go up to 80%, which is not feasible in practice"". Not so: if choosing between OOM or 1.8x slowdown, I will of course choose the latter. - ""for a fair comparison, we do not change any hyperparameters"" Again, not relevant: in a real application (which is where this paper contributes), we of course change the learning rate when batch size changes. - ""the accuracy drop of sampling may be greater than EXACT"" Again, whether that drop is too much depends entirely on the actual application.

The authors propose an approach called UCB-Filtering-with-Delayed-Feedback (UCB-FDF) for this problem and provide a theoretical analysis showing that UCB-FDF achieves the optimal regret bounds. Their analysis also implies that logarithmic regret and incentive cost growth rates are achievable under this setting. These theoretical results are supported by empirical experiments, e. g. using Amazon review data. The main concern with this paper is that the considered challenges have all been tackled already in different bandit settings, so the novelty here is that they are being tackled altogether. It would be more convincing if experiments included baselines from these existing settings to motivate the need for a new strategy rather than simply relying on methods that have been proposed previously to address each of these problems independently; the experiments currently contain only a baseline for bandits with self-reinforcing user preference, which has been added during the rebuttal phase.",0.8169646859169006,0.2995387725532055

They asked for more justification on why the change of task for the discriminator from classification to generation would improve performance. The authors responded to these comments, clarifying the proof of Lemma 4.1 in the appendix. They clarified that proposition 4.1 can be derived from Corollary 4.3 or Corollary 4.4. On the point of classical vs. enhanced discriminator the authors provided additional experiments. Reviewer rNQp commented that the method was easy to follow and noted the theoretical and empirical analysis. They expressed some concern that previous work on graph-based domain adaptation was inadequately addressed.

It proposes, in particular, a min-max formulation for backdoor defense, in which the inner maximum seeks a powerful trigger that leads to a high loss, while the outer minimum seeks to suppress the ""adversarial loss"", so as to unlearn the injected backdoor behaviors. To solve the minimax, the authors also propose a method, Implicit Backdoor Adversarial Unlearning (I-BAU). In addition, the authors also provide theoretical analysis including the convergence bound and generalization bound. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method is interesting and the implementation is nice. Overall, there is a fundamental flaw in the formulation: if the trigger is not additive (where there are many such examples of poisoning attacks that are not additive) this approach should fail completely. Not having experiments that discuss such triggers that are not additive is a significant flaw in the presentation of the paper. Another flaw is that the trigger is assumed to be small norm. Unlike adversarial examples attacks (at test time), there is no reason for backdoor triggers to be of small norm. Given that the defense critically relies on these two flawed assumptions, and the extent of how the proposed algorithm is sensitive to these assumptions are not properly addressed in the experiments, this paper is on the border line.",0.7829316854476929,0.21047131562690166

The authors propose a set of regularization methods aimed at improving diversity, and benchmark these augmentations on five ensemble methods and a dozen environments. 3 of 4 reviewers generally praised the method's simplicity and generality, and found the experiments convincing. Reviewer a9sA describes it as ""clearly written and easy to follow"", although others found clarity lacking in parts. There was agreement among these 3 reviewers that this was an interesting problem to tackle. Reviewer TfGq notes that this method lacks theoretical justification or guarantees, but that as a largely empirical paper this is perhaps of secondary importance. Reviewers 6miY and a9sA had questions about the precise choice of metrics, hyperparameters and seeds; the resulting discussion cleared up many of these concerns. The most critical reviewer, i4M1, disputes the existence of the phenomenon at all, saying that ""Neural networks converge to different solutions given the initialization is different and multiple local minima."" The remainder of i4M1's criticisms seem centered on the choice of environments and the number of seeds (also raised by other reviewers). The issue of seeds has been addressed partially and the authors have committed to strengthening their results in this regard. Reviewer i4M1's statement on the convergence of neural networks to different minima matches a bit of dated folk wisdom about neural networks, but the AC disputes this. The authors have cited a study from before the DL era properly began that identifies this issue and Section 5 addresses these criticisms directly. In practice, modern neural networks, especially with non-saturating activations, tend to be surprisingly consistent across random seeds when trained against the same data stream, and more recent work posits that the loss landscape is less riddled with local minima than with saddle points (see e. g. Dauphin et al, 2014). _Equivalent_ minima are of course common due to scaling and permutation symmetries but SGD has a well documented preference for low norm solutions in the former case, and the authors' have chosen methods that would at least conceivably overcome these issues, by focusing on summary statistics of the representations rather than their precise values (and indeed, CKA is designed with these concerns in mind). Despite i4M1's incredulity I am inclined to agree with the majority of reviewers and view the paper as a worthwhile contribution to the body of knowledge (purely empirical though it may be) on both NN ensemble methods and DRL ensembles in particular. The introduction of measures from economics is clever and original, and the results are promising. A more exhaustive study on the entire Atari57 benchmark but can appreciate the resource problem this poses, and find that the suite of considered environments, combined with the augmentation of 5 different DRL ensemble methods, strikes a good balance. I concur on the issue of seeds and would encourage authors to include as many as possible for the camera ready, but on balance would recommend acceptance.",0.7918288111686707,0.32469091464204397

I understand this kind of private request to the AC to dismiss unfavourable reviews (especially if they do not respond) is becoming common--I find it unhelpful--I can see who and who has not responded.

"t. t. t. r. a strong argument for the paper. Strengths  [1]     [1]          YC, Wang YC, Lin CW. MRI is a very difficult problem to solve ##################################.","The paper considers the problem of accelerated magnetic resonance imaging where the goal is to reconstruct an image from undersampled measurements. The paper proposes a zero-shot self-supervised learning approach for accelerated deep learning based magnetic resonance imaging. The approach partitions the measurements from a single scan into two disjoint sets, one set is used for self-supervised learning, and one set is used to perform validation, specifically to select a regularization parameter. The set that is used for self-supervised learning is then again split into two different sets, and a network is trained to predict the frequencies from one set based on the frequencies in the other set. This enables accelerated MRI without any training data. The paper evaluates on the FastMRI dataset, a standard dataset for deep learning based MRI research, and the paper compares to a trained baseline and an un-trained baseline (DIP). The paper finds their self-supervised method to perform very well compared to both and shows images that indicate excellent performance. It would have been even better to compare the method on the test set of the FastMRI competition to have a proper benchmark comparison. Here is how the discussion went: - Reviewer pt6r is supportive of acceptance, but notes a few potential irregularities, such as the method pre-trained on brain and tested on knees performing better than the method pre-trained on knees and tested on knees, and not providing a comparison of the computational cost. The authors added a table to the appendix revealing that the computational costs are very high, much higher than for DIP even. The reviewer was content with the response and raised the score. - Reviewer mBMk argues that the contribution is too incremental compared to prior work, in particular relative to the results of [Yaman et al., 2020], and also argues that the idea of partitioning the measurements is not new. The authors argue in response that their approach of partitioning the measurements is new, and the reviewer was inclined to raise the score slightly, but still thinks that the novelty on the technical ML side remains limited, and doesn't want to back the submission too much, and did not raise the score at the end in the system. - Reviewer 19v3 has the concern that the all elements used (transfer learning, plug-and-play, etc) are well known techniques and have been applied before to MRI, and therefore thinks that the paper does not clear the bar for acceptance. The paper points out that while those ideas might be applied for the first time to MRI, they have been used before in other image reconstruction problems, in particular denoising. I've read the paper in detail too, and am somewhat on the fence: I think it's very valuable to see that a clever application of self-supervised learning works so well for MRI. I agree with the reviewers that the technical novelty is relatively small, but on the other hand this is the first time that I see self-supervised learning being applied that successfully to MRI. I don't share the concern about novelty --- yes, the paper's approach builds on prior work, but it's not clear from the literature how well such a well tuned self-supervised learning approach would work. What I would have liked to see in addition to the experimental results is a proper evaluation on the FastMRI dataset: An advantage of the FastMRI dataset is that it provides a benchmark and if researchers evaluate on that benchmark (on the testset/validation set) we can compare different methods well. The paper under review doesn't do that, it only evaluates on 30 test slices, and thus it's hard to benchmark the method. Also, the paper would benefit from more ablation studies. In conclusion, I would be happy to discuss this paper at the conference, and think that other researchers in the intersection of deep learning and inverse problems would be too, and therefore recommend acceptance.",0.7663890719413757,0.27449510241677233

In relation to prior work they clarify that they focus on the contrastive unsupervised case and also do a good job in answering other reviewer concerns relative to novelty and results.

The submission first proves rigorous generalization bounds for overparameterized linear regression (motivated in a general sense by the NTK); there are settings where this improves upon existing bounds. It extends the case to a matrix recovery model, showing that it's not limited to the linear regime. Finally, experimental results show that the risk decomposition holds empirically for neural nets. The numerical scores would place this paper slightly below the cutoff. The reviewers feel that the paper is well written and have not identified anything that looks like a critical flaw. They have a variety of concerns, mostly centered around whether the results apply to practical situations. Specifically, they're worried about (1) the theory not applying directly to neural nets, (2) the high-noise setting being less relevant for modern deep learning, and (3) whether there's a realistic situation where it improves over past bounds. Regarding (1), the theory covers not only the linear regime, but also the nonlinear matrix recovery regime; combined with the empirical results, this seems pretty solid by the standards of a DL theory paper. Regarding (2), even though the most common benchmarks indeed have low label noise, the high-noise regime still seems worth understanding (after all, we'd like our nets to work in domains like medicine). I haven't dug deeply enough to properly evaluate (3), but the author response seems believable to me. Overall, the paper strikes me as creative and well-executed. Regardless of whether the theory is easily extendable to neural nets, this seems like an interesting paper that can be built on in future work.

,"The paper proposes a novel approach to graph representation learning. In particular, a graph auto-encoder is proposed that aims to better capture the topological structure by utilising a neighbourhood reconstruction and a degree reconstruction objective. An optimal-transport based objective is proposed for the neighbourhood reconstruction that optimises the 2-Wasserstein distance between the decoded distribution and an empirical estimate of the neighbourhood distribution. An extensive experimental analysis is performed, highlighting the benefits of the proposed approach on a range of synthetic datasets to capture structure information. The experimental results also highlight its robustness across 9 different real-world graph datasets (ranging from proximity-oriented to structure-oriented datasets). Strengths: - The problem studied is well motivated and the method proposed is well placed in the literature. - The method is intuitive and the way that the neighbourhood information is reconstructed appears novel. - The empirical comparisons are extensive. Weaknesses: - Some of the choices in matching neighborhoods seem a bit arbitrary and not sufficiently justified. - The scalability of the proposed method is questionable. The method has a high complexity of O(Nd^3) (where N is the number of nodes and d is the average node degree). The authors address this problem by resorting to the neighborhood sampling method (without citing the prior art), which is only very briefly discussed in the paper. - The reviewers have also expressed concerns about the fixed sample size q. The question of how the neighbour-sampling is handled when a node has less than q neighbours remains unanswered.",0.0,0.031390089799450446

The proposed model CPL is entirely supervised, and exhibits little generalization.","This paper proposes a new dataset called ComPhy to evaluate the ability of models to infer physical properties of objects and to reason about their interactions given these physical properties. The paper also presents an oracle model (named oracle because it requires gold property labels at training time) that is modular and carefully hand designed, but shows considerable improvement over a series of baselines. The reviewers for this submission had several concerns including: (a) [VByS] ""concerns are about the complexity that the proposed method can handle""\ (b) [VByS] ""the method is only demonstrated on a simple synthetic dataset""\ (c) [8BUA] ""I am struggling to see any direct application""\ (d) [8BUA] ""choosing 4-videos as reference"" -- why use ref videos, why use 4\ (e) [8BUA] ""Baselines showing results with ground-truth object properties should be reported""\ (f) [3cQE] ""no innovation in the type or structure of questions asked""\ (g) [3cQE] ""neither the CPL framework nor the implementation of any module is novel""\ (h) [DJEq] ""The only difference is that this paper infers hidden properties instead of collisions""\ (i) [DJEq] ""The dataset is not comprehensive enough"" -- only 2 properties and simplistic and synthetic videos\ The authors have provided detailed responses to these concerns and I discuss these below. The authors have addressed (c),(d) and (e) well in their rebuttal. I don't think (a) is concerning. The proposed model is not expected to solve the dataset entirely inspite of having access to gold properties at training time. As the authors mention, this indicates the complexity of the task at hand. The authors also address (f) well. I dont think there is any need for innovation in the structure of questions asked. QA is merely a mechanism to probe the model, and using CLVERER style questions seems appropriate. I disagree with the sentiment behind (g). The proposed oracle model clearly inherits modules from past works and assembles them to suit the needs of the dataset. It is this assembly that differentiates it from past works. This is true of most papers in our field, including ones that are widely acknowledged to be important papers. The underlying modules in proposed networks are rarely novel, but their assembly can lead to improvements on benchmarks. Furthermore, the oracle model, isnt the central contribution of this work. The dataset is, and hence, the requirement for novelty is reduced. The oracle is meant to serve as a guideline to show what one may achieve given gold labels at training, and it serves that purpose well. Re (h), my takeaway is that inferring properties based on their dynamics and without any link to their appearance is an important step, and past datasets do not exhibit this characteristic. And thus, in spite of being a limited differentiation from CLEVERER, I think this is interesting. Re: (b) and (i) I do agree with some aspects of these, with the reviewers. I think its still valuable to have a dataset with synthetic videos, given that models today are unable to solve this dataset. Moving to more realistic videos is a next step. However, as the reviewer [DJEq] points out, it would be desirable to add more physical properties and add more complex scene elements like ramps. That would have added a lot more diversity to the dataset -- visually, with regards to physical properties and with regards to the types of reasoning required. Having said that, I believe that the dataset in its present form is still valuable to the community, and hence I recommend acceptance. I think adding more physical properties and scene elements will have made this a much stronger submission.",0.8010513782501221,0.261843690407221

Finally, I would like to ask the authors to avoid protraying the misconception that we don't need large and powerful search spaces. In fact, as already hinted on in Section 6, we *do* need larger and more exciting search spaces in order to discover entirely novel architectures. Also the multi-objective nature of NAS is not to be undervalued, so the take-away of the paper should *not* be that we should design NAS benchmarks with really small & strong search spaces, but that, given a specific problem and objective, it may be prudent to evaluate whether the whole power of a given NAS search space is needed or whether it can be reduced to its essential parts.",0.8023441433906555,0.3375249400057576

It formally proves some of the conjectures/informal-statements in an earlier work by Dai and Wipf (2019) in the case of linear VAE and linear manifold, and disproves the same for the nonlinear case. In particular, it proves, by analyzing the objective and its gradient-flow dynamics, that VAE captures the intrinsic dimension of data distribution correctly. For nonlinear cases, the paper shows a counterexample to the conjecture in (Dai & Wipf; 2019) where the support of VAE generators is a superset of that of data distribution. Two of the reviewers had raised following specific concerns -- (i) Theory only considers linear encoders and linear/1-hidden layer nonlinear decoders, (ii) The convergence behavior during training is only provided for linear VAEs, (iii) Some statements in the introduction/abstract misrepresent the results in (Dai & Wipf; 2019). However the authors have adequately addressed (i) and (ii) in their response -- the paper shows that the correct manifold will only be recovered in the linear case; in the nonlinear case, even for simple manifolds (1-hidden layer) the correct manifold is not recovered as shown by the counterexamples. Authors have also promised to modify the statements in the abstract and introduction to address the concern in (iii). Other two reviewers are largely positive about the paper.

The method adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each individual parameter according to its sensitivity (a proxy for the parameter's contribution to the model performance). The approach encourages the use of under fitted parameters while preventing overfitting in the well-fitted ones. Experimental results are presented covering a wide range of tasks and in combination with several optimisers, showing improvements in model generalization. The paper is very well written and easy to follow (as mentioned by Reviewers NSqH, 4pzE and sSHP). The authors provided a strong rebuttal including new experiments, like training using CNN based architectures (as requested by Reviewers sSHP and MzBV). Reviewer sSHP requested these results to be reported with STD, the AC encourages the authors to do so for the camera ready. Reviewer MzBV points out that the paper could be improved by giving a motivation of the update rule and proving convergence. However, still recommends accepting the paper due to the novelty in the idea of not taking redundant parameters as something inevitable and devising an effective strategy to improve it. This idea was also appreciated by the other reviewers. While the AC agrees that adding these points would improve the work, it takes as valid the point made by the authors. Namely, that the intuition behind the update rule is quite clear, and many other reasonable variants were ablated (in Appendix A.4.4). Furthermore, the empirical evidence shows that the method improves generalization. Reviewer NSqH points out that while SAGE improves the model’s generalization performance for lightly compressed models, its performance becomes more susceptible to pruning when the model is compressed heavier. While the authors responded with good points, the AC encourages them to follow the reviewer’s advice and incorporate further experiments studying this issue (e. g. other datasets).

Prior already demonstrated the equivalence of random pruning and contemporary pruning at initialization techniques. ### Recommendation I recommend Accept (poster). However, I do want to stress that there is a significant overlap with previous work. The paper does appropriately attribute observations to previous work. However, there is some risk that readers may misinterpret the title and claim results as a wholly new observation about random pruning, where the reality is instead much more nuanced. Given that the work points to new methodological directions on considering scaling the network as an additional parameter to consider in pruning observations, I do believe these results -- even if narrower in scope that can be interpreted -- provide value to the community.",0.8277126550674438,0.4002669023142921

The results improve over existing (though related) techniques. ### Discussion #### Strenghts - An interesting and timely topic to study - Results show non-compute improvements #### Weakness The primary weakness noted among the reviewers was the lack of study on actual decoding performance. As I note below, this is a serious oversight that given the already existing theoretical work in the area warrants study as the community should begin to turn towards mapping that theory to practice. ### Recommendation I recommend Accept (poster).

"a. The proposed self-distillation framework is interesting and technically sound. b. The pre-trained language models, contrastive learning for sentence modeling, pseudo labeling for data augmentation/generation are quite common in the literature. c. The proposed self-distillation framework is interesting and technically sound.","For pairs of pieces of text, the central idea of this paper is to combine the approaches of using bi-encoders (where a vector is formed from each text then compared), which are easily trained in an unsupervised manner, with cross-encoders (where the two texts are related at the token level), which are normally trained in a supervised manner. The chief contribution of this paper is to train a combined model (as a ""trans-encoder"") by doing co-training of both model types in an alternating cyclic self-distillation framework. The paper suggests that this allows unsupervised training of a cross-encoder. This claim met some pushback from the reviewers, since the method does require good quality aligned text pairs (much like a traditional MT system does), and so the result is a task-specific sentence-pair modeling approach rather than a generic unsupervised learning approach. In the discussion, downsides included the claims of ""unsupervised"" being overstated, the genuine remaining need for related sentence pairs, the lack of a more theoretical understanding of why this works, and the feeling that the paper is not yet fully mature. Upsides include solid work building from existing models, big performance improvements over SimCSE, novelty in combining previous ideas in a new way for a new problem, and good experiments. To my mind, while the requirement of related sentence pairs does mean the model is task-specific and less than fully unsupervised, this is still a common and useful scenario, the performance of the model is strong, and, while the proposed model is built from existing components and ideas, they are combined in an interesting new way to achieve an intriguing and strong new way of training models, and the discussion here (and now in Appendix A.2) of what the authors had to do to get the model to work in terms of choosing different losses, etc., convincingly demonstrated that the authors had thought significantly and deeply about the nature of their proposal and how to get it to work well. Moreover the authors were able to work expeditiously during the reviewing period to address other weaknesses, such as now providing results with other methods than SimCSE (DeCLUTR and Contrastive Tension) and on other language models (RoBERTa).

Cons: Significantly improving experimental results would make me reconsider the rating. ################################################################################################################","Meta Review for Variational Neural Cellular Automata This paper proposes a generative model, a VAE whose decoder is implemented via neural cellular automata (NCA). The authors show that this model performs well for reconstruction, but they also show that the architecture has some robustness properties against damage during generation. Experiments were conducted on 3 datasets: MNIST, Noto Emoji, and CelebA, and while experimental results were great on MNIST, the method was less performant so on the other two datasets, although there is clear evidence that the model can learn to generate meaningful images. For the robustness experiments, the authors show that VNCA is robust to perturbations (occlusions) and show that the model has a reasonable degree of robustness even without ever seeing any perturbations at training time. All authors agree that this model is an improvement over neural cellular automata, and that the approach is interesting and the results are sound (and even useful). Initially, there were concerns that NCA's were simply convolutional neural networks (the connection is already known, and not the point of the paper), and issues with comparison with baselines for damage reconstruction tasks, but these were addressed by the authors (which the reviewers have acknowledged, and have improved their scores). The authors have also responded to the concerns of reviewer cp9d, and due to the lack of response from cp9d, I assessed the authors' response myself and find that they do address the concerns (in particular, they removed claims of super-resolution, and improved the clarity of the work). With that in mind, the score of 5 is viewed as a score of 6 from my perspective (giving this work effectively an average score of 6). After my assessment of the paper and reviews, I agree with reviewer kwgv, as they have summarized the work in their original review: - The authors propose a variational neural cellular automaton, which learns to generate images by iterating the transition rule. - The paper is interesting, with good results, and a good fit for ICLR. - The paper solves an interesting problem on the topic of neural cellular automata. - There are some doubts/limitations that I have asked the authors to address (mainly concerning the architecture of the model). - There are some missing references and details that would help the readers to get a better sense of the subject. Crucially, kwgv have acknowledged that the *authors have improved the paper significantly after the reviews, and they have addressed all questions and comments that [they] raised* (especially with regards to the last 2 points), and kwgv has subsequently championed the work with a score of 8. With the increased scores from kwgv and AnwX in mind, and also with what I view as an increased score of 6 from cp9d (in the lack of response from the reviewer, the authors have addressed the concerns in my judgement), my conclusion is that this is a nice work that bridges NCAs with generative models, and I think the work will be a useful addition to the growing literature in this space. I will recommend it for acceptance at ICLR 2022 as a poster.",0.8093252778053284,0.3505914080888033

This paper explores whether, for graph convolutional networks (GCNs), this is a general phenomenon, or if there are some circumstances under which a GCN can still perform well in a heterophilous setting. This paper characterizes one such setting under a contextual stochastic block model (CSBM) distribution with two classes (generalized in the appendix to multiple classes). The main takeaway is that there are indeed scenarios where a GCN can be expected to perform well, even under heterophilic neighborhoods. There are limitations, and the reviewers have been fairly thorough in pointing these out: the analysis is specific to GCNs under CSBM, and there are a number of assumptions on the node label/feature/neighborhood distributions. The non-linear operations in the GCN have also been dropped. Even still, the reviewers were generally satisfied that the experiments backed up the claims in this specific scenario. There is still quite a bit more to do in order to make this a more general result. Essentially, this paper shows that heterophily is not always a problem. One reviewer has stated that it is not always considered a problem anyway, but at least this paper outlines a specific scenario in which this is theoretically true. However, there is still a large space of “bad” heterophily, and this paper leaves open what these are, and how to deal with them. It is also possible that there are other “good” scenarios as well that are unexplored. Still, in the narrow scope under which the analysis lies, the paper is clear and accomplishes what it sets out to do. I would encourage the authors to ensure that the paper incorporates the suggestions of the reviewers, particularly with regard to scope, to ensure that the paper is properly grounded in its claims.

Assumption 2: this is a property of the algorithm.,"The paper proposes a novel method for (diverse) client selection at each round of a federated learning procedure with the aim of improving performance in terms of convergence, learning efficiency and fairness. The main idea is to introduce a facility location objective to quantify how representative/informative is the gradient information of a given set of clients is, and then choose a subset that maximizes this objective. Given the monotonicity and submodularity of the proposed facility location objective, the authors have been able to provide theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on two data sets (FEMNIST and CelebA) show the effectiveness to the proposed approach and algorithm. The reviewers had a number of concerns most of which were addressed in the authors response. The reviewers believe that the theoretical results of the paper are incremental given the prior work (see the reviews for more details); however, the reviewers (as well as myself) agree that the proposed method is novel and can provide significant practical advantage. Utilizing sub modular objectives for diverse selection is a well-known (and effective approach), but I am seeing it in the context of federated learning for the first time. My suggestion to the authors: (i) Improve the experimental section by adding a few more common data sets (such as CIFAR when data is distributed in a heterogeneous manner). CelebA and FEMNIST are not really the best data sets to try in FL (although they are commonly used). (ii) One of the reviewers had several critical comments about the theoretical results, please address those in the updated version. (iii) Please clarify in more detail how the theoretical and algorithmic contributions of there paper go beyond the recent work of (mirzasoleiman et el. 2020); (iv) iIt seems to me that the paper is missing some references on client selection in federated learning.

The basic motivation is to view recommendation as applying some form of intervention, implying a distributional shift after the recommendation/intervention. Distribution shift brings tremendous difficulty to traditional causal inference or missing data theory perspective of recommender systems as it violates the distributional overlapping assumption: in simple terms, if the model recommends radically different set of items, there isn't much you can say about its generalization ability; on the other hand, if the model only recommends items that it already observed during training (no distribution shift at all), it would inherent all the biases which already exist in the data. To that end, this paper proposed a domain transportation perspective by introducing a Wasserstein distance constrained risk minimization to find interventions that can best transport the patterns it learns from the observed domain to the post-intervention domain. The paper received overall borderline scores. All the reviewers acknowledged that the proposed perspective is novel and has the potential to spark a new direction for future work. The reviewers raised concerns, ranging from the bounds in the paper, sensitivity of the optimization w. r. t. the hyperparameter, to some relevant but missing baselines. The authors provided very detailed response and revised the paper quite substantially to address most of the feedback. I also read the paper myself given the borderline scores, and I think the authors did a reasonably good job improving the paper and I agree this paper provides an interesting and novel perspective on viewing recommendation, though I also agree with one reviewer that the idea of ""partially extrapolation"" can be further explored. My major complaint is around experimental evaluation. It seems to me that only the semi-synthetic experiment actually makes sense in this context (where the measure is based on the unobserved relevance as opposed to observed click), as the traditional random-split-on-clicks evaluation would inevitably favor models with little distributional shift (the training and test data essentially come from the same distribution, maybe not so with a sequential setting but still close). Furthermore, the inclusion of Yahoo R3 and Coat dataset is even more confusing, as the associated test set implies random exposure which is certainly not what this paper aims to address, unless I am missing something in which case more clarification would be nice. My overall assessment of the paper is still leaning towards positive but I also wouldn't be too upset if this paper doesn't end up making it. However, if accepted, I do want the authors to carefully revise the presentation of the experimental results for the final version.",0.7812504768371582,0.34563922565552146

These perturbations consist of an adversarial ""ghost"" agent (attacker) that emits noise perturbations volume, position and category determined by policies that are trained to maximise the negative rewards for the navigation agent in zero-sum game.

It introduces nuisance-randomized distillation (NuRD), constructed by reweighting the observed data, to break the nuisance-label dependence and find the most informative representation to predict the label. Experiments on several datasets show that by using a classifier learned on this representation, NuRD is able to improve the classification performance by limiting the impact of nuisance variables. The main concerns were about the presentation and organization of the paper, which was heavily focused on the theoretical justifications but fell short in explaining the intuitions and implementation details.

I would delete it...............,"The paper studies the problem of multi-class calibration, proposing new notion of ""top-label calibration"", and presenting and comparing new algorithms for multi-class calibration. Reviewers generally found the paper to be well-written, and tackling a foundational problem. There were some questions regarding the experiments: (1) _Lack of explanation of why unnormalised beats normalised. _ One of the paper's main empirical findings is that using an unnormalised predictor with histogram binning (CW-HB) can significantly outperform a normalised one (N-HB). There is however limited discussion prior to this of why such behaviour is expected. (2) _Lack of comparison to isotonic regression. _ One can apply isotonic regression in conjunction with one of the M2B algorithms in Sec 3. It is of interest whether isotonic regression + a suitable M2B wrapper compares to HB + an M2B wrapper. (3) _Comparison to OVA calibration_. One reviewer raised the concern that the new algorithms proposed in this work are not too surprising; e. g., using a binary calibrator of one label vs everyone else appears natural. (4) _Overloaded appendices_. One reviewer pointed out that some material in the Appendix is not referenced in the body, thus making the work not self-contained. For point (1), the response indicates that the unnormalised model can obtain distribution-free guarantees. The lack of such a guarantee for the normalised model does not suggest that such a guarantee is impossible, however. Certainly the present work need not solve this issue in entirety, but if this is intended to be a main takeaway of the experiments, a little more discussion in the body seems advisable. On this note, from my reading, the experiments seek to demonstrate that suitable M2B reductions can dramatically improve the performance of HB. However, with the use of multiple evaluation metrics (Top-ECE, Top-MCE, Classwise-ECE) it is not clear if the authors intend to promote one specific M2B reduction as generally favourable; further, the text in Sec 3.2 suggests that N-HB is the method considered in prior works, which then seems to do better on top-label ECE than prior works. Which suggests that for this particular metric, one does not gain much from other M2B reductions? For point (2), the response argued that ""the main message of the paper is not about HB vs other binary calibrators, but proposing a single agnostic framework for achieving multiple notions of multiclass calibration using any binary calibrator"". From my reading of the paper, I think this claim is accurate, and agree that the conceptual advance is the generic M2B framework itself For point (3), the authors responded to suggest that while Algorithm 2 performs a natural one-versus-all calibration, this is different from Algorithm 1. Further, the latter is shown to be useful in Table 2 (bottom panel). For point (4), the revision involved referencing relevant material in the Appendix. These seem better, though I would prefer if theorem statements (e. g., Theorem 1) appear in full or as sketches in the body. Further to the above, I have a couple of minor suggestions: - consider removing most hline's from Tables 1 -- 3 - keep the ordering of Algorithms 1 -- 4 the same as that in which methods are presented in Table 1. **Summary**. The paper considers a foundational problem. It makes one simple yet interesting contribution in its definition of top-label calibration. Detailing the various multi-class calibrators in Section 3 is another contribution: albeit simple, it does illuminate the subtle issue of the role of normalisation in post-hoc calibration, which empirically is shown to have non-trivial impact. There are certainly avenues where the paper could be further strengthened, but overall I do see it as potentially being of broad interest to the community, and inspiring future work. My recommendation is thus for the authors to further incorporate the reviewers' detailed suggestions and the comments above, which can broaden the clarity, scope and impact of the work.",0.7917256355285645,0.33471904076155157

In this work, the authors address this by building on an existing technique of shallow exploration, which consists in exploring over the final layer of the network only, allowing to decouple the deep neural network feature representation learning from most of the exploration of the network parameters. More specifically, they propose a simple and effective UCB-based strategy using this shallow exploration scheme, for which they provide a theoretical analysis. The proposed approach builds on several ideas for previous works, including borrowing proof techniques and theoretical arguments.

The method is based on independently training three neural networks with different loss functions which are then combined via a linear combination where the coefficients for a given confidence level can be found by the root-finding algorithm. A specific initialization scheme allows to employ the method to OOD detection. Reviewers agreed on the importance of the problem of producing reliable confidence estimates. The proposed method addressed some of the limitations of the existing approaches, and reviewers valued that a theoretical as well as an empirical analysis is provided. On of the main criticisms was that the theoretical derivation of the method is based on the assumption of the noise being homoscedastic. This however is a common issue with other methods in this area, which are nevertheless all applied (and seem to work) on heteroscedastic data as well and are outperformed by the proposed method. Another main point that was criticized was that the empirical analysis was limited. In turn the authors added another experiments on another dataset and with another network architecture (a LSTM) to their analysis.

The paper begins with a very accessible overview of key concepts from tropical geometry, and shows how ReLU networks can be thought of as tropical polynomials. It gives an efficient K-means-based algorithm for pruning units in a way that approximately minimizes the Hausdorff distance between certain polytopes. Experiments show that the method outperforms other methods based on tropical geometry and is competitive with SOTA methods from a few years ago. I think the reviewers, authors and I all agree on the following points: tropical geometry is a mathematical topic not commonly used in our field and for which it is difficult to find expert reviewers (notice that most of the citations aren't from ML venues). The paper is well-written, and the authors have taken pains to present the required concepts in an accessible way. Nobody has raised any concerns about correctness. While this isn't the first pruning method that uses tropical geometry, the algorithm is novel and interesting. It's expensive, but not unreasonably so. The experiments are a proof-of-concept: they use small networks by today's standards, and the baselines aren't the current SOTA. The average scores are slightly below the usual cutoff. The reviewers are concerned about whether this method is useful, given that is based on different principles from current methods and can't quite compete with current SOTA. But my own sense is that this is a paper that we'd like to have at ICLR. It gives a clear, accessible introduction to tropical geometry and demonstrates its usefulness for practical deep learning. It demonstrates competitiveness with fairly strong baselines, which is all we should expect from methods that haven't benefited from years of hill-climbing on the same handful of ideas.

. g.,"PAPER: This paper introduces a new method to learn joint representations from multimodal data, with potentially missing data. The primary novelty builds from the idea of semi-supervised VAE, introducing the concept of bi-directional information flow, which is termed “mutual supervision”. This approach brings the same advantages of semi-supervised VAE to the multimodal setting, allowing the cross-modal interactions to be modeled in the latent space. DISCUSSION: The discussion brought many important issues, addressed by both reviewers and authors. In general, it seems that most reviewers appreciate the technical novelty of the paper, related to the mutual supervision. While some concerns were expressed about the similarity with semi-supervised VAE (Joy et al., 2021), I would agree with other reviewers and the authors that the extension is not straightforward. Bi-directional information flow is a worthwhile novelty in itself. One reviewer also mentioned a concern about previous work on multimodal generative models; previous work on the same topic should not preclude new papers, as long new technical ideas are proposed. The final observation is about modeling more than 3 modalities. This is effectively a challenge with the proposed idea and should be acknowledged in the paper, but it is also an issue for many other approaches. New research will be needed to study 3+ modalities, but it should be seen as a future work direction. SUMMARY: Based on the reviews, discussion and personal reading of the paper, I lean towards acceptance of this paper. The paper introduces a new technical idea (bi-directional information flow, aka mutual supervision) which enables multimodal representation learning with missing data. The authors should revise their paper to acknowledge potential limitations of the approach (e. g., complexity challenges with 3+ modalities), but the idea is very interesting and worth publication.",0.8098224997520447,0.09287397855271895

"e. The paper should be self-contained. Pros: The experiments in section 4. The experiments verify such measurements are closely related to the performance. Nevertheless, in the MOPO and Morel papers, different uncertainties are not rigorously studied. f. The paper should be self-contained.","This paper empirically studies various design choices in offline model-based RL algorithms, with a focus on MOPO (Model-based Offline Policy Optimization). Among the key design choices is the uncertainty measure used in MOPO that provides an (approximate) lower bound on the performance, the horizon rollout length, and the number of model used in ensemble. The reviewers are positive about the paper, found the experiments thorough, and the results filling a gap in the current literature. They have raised several issues in their reviews, many of which are addressed in the rebuttal and the revised paper. I would like to recommend acceptance of the paper. Also since the results of this work might be of interest to many researchers working on model-based RL, I also recommend a spotlight presentation for this work. I have some additional comments: (1) The paper studies the correlation of uncertainty measures with the next-state MSE, with the aim of showing which one has a higher correlation. The underlying assumption is that the next-state MSE is the gold standard that we should aim for. If we go back to the MOPO paper, we see that to define an uncertainty-penalized reward, we need an upper bound on the absolute value of G(s, a), which is the difference between the expected value of the value function at the next-state according to the true model and the estimated model. If we assume that the value function belongs to the Lipschitz function class w. r. t. a metric d, this upper bound is proportional to the 1-Wasserstein distance between the true next-state distributions and the model's distribution. If the dynamics is deterministic, 1-Wasserstein distance becomes the d(T(s,a),T^(s,a)) . If the distance d is the Euclidean distance, this becomes the squared error. Therefore, the squared error makes sense for deterministic dynamics, and it only provides an upper bound of |G(s,a)| . If the environment is not deterministic, the squared error may not be a reasonable gold standard anymore to compare the correlation of various uncertainty measures with. The paper introduces a generic MDP framework, but does not mention anything about its focus on MBRL for deterministic environments until the last sentence of its conclusion. Please clarify this in your camera ready paper. (2) The experiments are conducted using 3 or 4 seeds. Although this is the common practice in the deep RL community, it is too small. Standard deviations in Tables 1, 2, ... are computed with 3 seeds, which would be cringeworthy to statisticians and empirical scientists.

Pros: A sufficient survey should be conducted on layer fusion of BERT.","This paper has a deep analysis of the over-smoothing phenomenon in BERT from the perspective of graph. Over-smoothing refers to token uniformity problem in BERT, different input patches mapping to similar latent representation in ViT and the problem of shallower representation better than deeper (overthinking). The authors build a relationship between Transformer blocks and graphs. Namely, self-attention matrix can be regarded as a normalized adjacency matrix of a weighted graph. They prove that if the standard deviation in layer normalization is sufficiently large, the outputs of the transformer stack will converge to a low-rank subspace, resulting in over-smoothing. In this paper, they also provide theoretical proof why higher layers can lead to over-smoothing. Empirically , they investigate the effects of the magnitude of the two standard deviations between two consecutive layers on possible over-smoothing in diverse tasks. In order to overcome over-smoothing, they propose a series of hierarchical fusion strategy that adaptively fuses presentation from different layers, including concatenation fusion, max fusion and self-gate fusion into post-normalization. These strategies reduce similarities between tokens and outperforms BERT baseline on a few datasets (GLUE, SWAG and SQuAD).

Their method, Randomized Return Decomposition, learns a reward function that provides immediate reward. The algorithm works by randomly subsampling trajectories and predicting the empirical return by regression using a sum of rewards on the included states. The method is compared to a variety of existing methods on Mujoco problems in “episodic reward” settings, where the reward is zero except for the final step of the episode, where it is the sum of rewards from the original task. Theoretical argument suggests the method is an interpolation of return decomposition (regress based on all states, not a subsample) and uniform reward distribution (send episodic reward to all states equally). By regressing with a subset of states, the method reduces compute for longer problems and is suggested to be more scalable.

This is a generalization of orthogonality of linear classifiers (linear classifiers with orthogonal weights) to the non-linear setting. It introduces the notion of a full and principal classifier, where the full classifier is one that minimizes the empirical risk, and the principal classifier is one that uses only partial information. The orthogonalization procedure assumes that the input domain, X can be divided into two sets of latent random variables Z1 and Z2 via a bijective mapping. The random variables Z1 are the principal random variables, and Z2 contains all other information. Z1 and Z2 are assumed to be conditionally independent given the target label. The paper outlines two approaches to construct orthogonal classifiers that operate only on Z2. The approach is highlighted in three applications: controlled style transfer, domain adaptation, and fair classification. The reviewers all found the proposed method to be principled and compelling. Beyond clarification questions and some discussion on related work, the reviewers raised a few issues that were subsequently addressed: 1) Additional baselines for domain adaptation and fairness. 2) Controlled style transfer being a new task with no established baselines, and 3) The feasibility of training a proper “full classifier” that minimizes the empirical risk, and its necessity in the approach.

The paper first provides a formal definition and theoretical evaluation of a class of MDPs for which the reward and transition are invariant to group elements (""group-invariant MDPs""). It goes on to describe equivariant versions DQN, SAC, and learning from demonstration (LfD). Experiments on a set of different manipulation tasks reveal that the proposed architectures outperform contemporary baselines in terms of sample complexity and generalizability, while ablations demonstrate the contribution of the different model components. The idea of structuring a neural architecture to exploit symmetry present in a domain as a means of improving sample complexity is compelling and principled. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, while the idea of exploiting symmetry in the context of deep RL is not new, the paper describes a variation of equivariant DQN that is effective for visual control domains (visuomotor control) that are more challenging and realistic than those considered previously. Second, the paper proposes novel equivariant versions of SAC and LfD and validates their effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Existing MIA attacks are relatively simple and rely on the test loss distribution at the query point and therefore the proposed algorithm sets a positive target mean training loss value and applies gradient ascent if the average loss of current training batch is smaller than it (in addition to the standard gradient descent step). The submission gives extensive experimental results demonstrating advantage over existing defense methods on several benchmarks. The primary limitation of the work is that it defends only against rather naive existing attacks which do not examine the model (but rely only on the loss functions).,0.8275184631347656,0.5379291921854019

In Table 2 it seems that the performance differ massively between both dimensions (8) and (9). g..,"This paper introduces a new technique for discovering closed-form functional forms (ordinary differential equations) that explain noisy observed trajectories x(t) where the ""label"" x'(t) = f(x(t), t) is not observed, but without trying to approximate it. The method first tries to approximate a smoother trajector x^hat(t), then relies on a variational formulation using a loss function over functionals {C_j}_j, defined in terms of an orthonormal basis {g_1, …, g_S} of sampling functions such that the sum of squares of all the C_j approximates the theoretical distance between f(x) and the solution f*(x). These sampling functions are typically chosen to be a basis of sine functions. The method is evaluated on several canonical ODEs (growth model, glycolitic oscillator, Lorenz chaotic attractor) and compared to gaussian processes-based differentiation, to spline-based differentiation, regularised differentiation, and applied to model the temporal effect of chemotherapy on tumor volume. Reviewers found that the paper was well-motivated and easy to follow (EBvJ), well evaluated (EBvJ), offering new perspectives to symbolic regression (79Ft). Reviewer vaG3 had their concerns addressed. Reviewer ZddY had concerns about the running time (a misunderstanding that was clarified) and the lack of comparison to a simple baseline consisting in double optimisation over f and x^hat(0) using Neural ODEs (the authors have added a Neural ODE baseline but were in disagreement with ZddY and 79Ft about their limitations). Reviewers engaged in a discussion with the authors, and the scores are 6, 6, 8, 8.

In general, outer loop optimization requires backpropagating over trajectories involving gradient updates in the inner loop optimization. It is claimed that one of main advantages of COMLN is able to compute the exact meta-gradients in a memory-efficient way, regardless of the length of adaptation trajectory. To this end, the forward-mode differentiation is used, with exploiting the Jacobian matrix decomposition. All the reviewers agree that the derivation of memory-efficient forward-mode differentiation is a significant contribution in the few-shot learning.

False positives are not allowed in the DPCP. g.) I feel that in the related work section on robust subspace recovery some important work is missing. g.) I think that the main result of this paper is rather surprising-- that random initialization can replace the need for explicit orthogonality constraint in DPCP.,"The paper looks at subspace recovery in the presence of outliers, of which there have been many formulations. They study a recent formulation, DPCP, but relax the requirement that the dimension of the subspace is known -- obviously very important in practice. The approach is quite clever: they exploit the fact that for this non-convex problem, starting a simple algorithm at a randomly chosen starting point will converge to a local minimizer, and they can run an ensemble of these algorithms (each with different starting points) and be guaranteed the solutions will span an appropriate subspace. This idea alone is a nice contribution. The paper has theory and experiments. Most reviewers were positive about the paper. The most critical review, by 1qf1, still acknowledged that this paper has a lot of potential, but in their opinion the paper was not in a state ready for acceptance, especially regarding the formulation of the main result, Theorem 7. The other reviewers were OK with the state of the paper, and the authors made changes in the rebuttal. Hence, while acknowledging the paper could possibly still be improved (what paper couldn't be!), I think the paper is in a good enough state to accept it for ICLR.

The parameterization of the full program derivation tree that can represent all programs up to a certain depth is interesting and novel. In its current form this won’t scale to large programs that require large tree depth, but is a promising first step in this direction.

The paper demonstrates it very thoroughly through many experiments and analysis of the loss surfaces. ### Decision + Discussion I find the paper to be very timely in its context. It has a remarkable coverage of experimental studies and different use cases: SAM + augmentation, +contrastive, +adversarial, +transfer learning; as well as ablation studies such as keeping first layers convolutional. The reviewers have asked further questions, and the authors were able to conduct respective experiments within the discussion period fully addressing all concerns and making the findings of the paper even more comprehensive and convincing. After the rebuttal 3 reviewers were for ""accept"", one ""marginally above"" and one ""marginally below"". In the latter case the concern was that the paper is an experimental study of a known method, SAM. While I understand that many researchers are expecting theoretical and innovative results from ICLR papers, I find that it does not prevent acceptance. Indeed, the experimental findings in this paper are on a ""hot"" topic, could be of wide interest and could lead to a change of paradigm in designing models towards more generic ones. On the other hand, it could just indicate that CNNs are not fully exploiting their potential, e. g. not exploiting the context well enough in the hidden layers? To get more insight, I am still wondering, how the predictions behave if the input is shifted by a few pixels in CNN and Transformers? It seems counterintuitive that making the first layers in ViT just an MLP of image patches is a good design. Furthermore, fully convolutional models allow to take input of an arbitrary size and average the predictions on the output if it happened to be larger than 1x1. Since convolutions are also used for e. g. semantic segmentation and generative models, one should not (and the authors do not in the paper) discard them too fast.

The paper investigates its hypothesis two ways: first by attempting to measure how capacity varies over time during training of existing deep RL methods, and second by proposing a new regularizer to attempt to preserve capacity. These experiments are set up well, and their results are convincing &mdash; while there is likely no perfect way to measure or preserve capacity, the methods chosen here make sense.

In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language modelling tasks. Each of these requires substantial algorithmic innovations. The reviewers all agree that this is a strong paper worthy of publication. The paper includes a useful review of previous differentiable stack models which nicely sets up the rest of the paper where the contributions are well motivated and clearly presented. The reviewers had a number of clarification questions, partly due to the author's use of overly concise citations for key algorithms rather than inline descriptions. This situation has been improved by updates made to the paper. The evaluation includes a series of synthetic experiments which are clear and provide a good elucidation of the various stack models properties. The practical evaluation on language modelling is more limited and serves mostly to demonstrate that the nondeterministic model can be scaled to a basic language modelling task. Overall this is a strong paper with a well motivated and clear hypothesis. It provides a substantial extension to the prior work on nondeterministic stack models and progresses this line of research toward practical applications.",0.7905118465423584,0.22020436371011393

False omission: a deterministic model is not a deterministic one. omission: a deterministic model is not a deterministic one. omission: a deterministic model is not a deterministic one.,"The paper extends MuZero to stochastic (but observable) MDPs. To represent stochastic dynamics, it splits transitions into two parts: a deterministic transition to an afterstate (incorporating all observations and actions up to the current time), followed by a stochastic outcome (accounting for new randomness that follows the last action). The transition to an afterstate is similar in spirit to ordinary MuZero's dynamics model; the stochastic outcome is learned by a VQ-VAE. At planning time, MuZero retains the MCTS lookahead from ordinary MuZero. Stochastic MuZero achieves impressive results: e. g., it maintains the original MuZero's strong performance on the deterministic game of Go, while improving on MuZero significantly (and achieving superhuman performance) on the stochastic game of backgammon. This is a strong paper overall: it presents a convincing and successful extension of the already-influential MuZero work, along with large-scale computational experiments confirming the utility of the approach. There are nonetheless a few weaknesses: first, compared to the original AlphaZero and MuZero work, it is perhaps less surprising that the given approach is successful, since it is more closely related to prior work. Second, due to the large-scale computational infrastructure needed, it is only possible to run some of the experiments once. This is not in itself a problem, but care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of such single-run experiments: e. g., any figures that show results of single-run experiments should have a clear warning label, and any statements such as ""stochastic MuZero performs better than original MuZero"" should be tempered with a caveat about how reliable these conclusions are likely to be. Section 5.4 (which runs shorter experiments using three random seeds each) makes a start at evaluating reliability, but (a) the headline results in previous sections do not contain any caveats or pointers to 5.4, and (b) 5.4 should explicitly acknowledge that it cannot hope to detect even quite-common failure cases with so few seeds.",0.8096888661384583,0.40433166983226937

In this case, learning is more effective if the typically successful approach for i. i. d. data (boosted decision trees + committee techniques) is combined with GNN to take into account the dependencies between samples. The main contribution of the paper with respect to previous work in the field is the introduction of a principled approach to pursue such integration. One important component of the proposed approach is played by the definition of a specific bi-level loss (efficient bilevel boosted smoothing) that allows for convergence guarantees under mild assumptions. Both theoretical and experimental contributions are sound and convincing, justifying the claimed merits of the proposed approach. Another strong point is the fact that the proposed approach is general and amenable to support a broad family of propagation rules. One weakness with the original submission was presentation, mainly because some key information was confined into the supplementary material.

The constraint set is quite natural for e. g. multi-class classification, where the output has to stay on on the probability manifold. The challenge here is that traditional universal approximation theory only guarantees that f^(x)≈f(x) , but can not guarantee that f^(x) lies exactly in the same constraint set as f(x) . The paper made a significant contribution in the theory of deep learning -- It is shown that the neural network can indeed approximate any regular functions while keep the output stay in the regular constraint set.

The authors are encouraged to make sure that these points are addressed in the final version of the paper.",0.8273364305496216,0.26745980264885083
