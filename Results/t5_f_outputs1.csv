The authors categorise continual learning methods into three categories, those that use cross task regularisation, those that employ some form of experience replay of previous training examples, and those that dynamically alter the network architecture for each task. Evaluation results from representative examples of these three paradigms are then presented and analysed. In general methods that incorporate experience reply appear to perform the best, while analysis of the predictive power of individual layers of the pretrained models suggests that some network layers are more robust to catastrophic forgetting than others, and that this also varies across architectures (BERT,","This paper proposes a novel perspective on the problem, and a novel conclusion out of",0.8300482630729675,0.2977960854768753

"### Description The paper demonstrates that efficient architectures such as transformers and MLP-mixers, which do not utilize translational equivariance in the design, when regularized with SAM (sharpness aware minimization) can achieve same or better performance as convolutional networks, in the vision problems where the convolutional networks were traditionally superior (with data augmentation or not, regularized or not). The paper demonstrates it very thoroughly through many experiments and analysis of the loss surfaces. ### Decision + Discussion I find the paper to be very timely in its context.
