The paper addresses a problem encountered in many real-world applications, i. e. the treatment of tabular data, composed of heterogeneous feature types, where samples are not i. i. d. In this case, learning is more effective if the typically successful approach for i. i. d. data (boosted decision trees + committee techniques) is combined with GNN to take into account the dependencies between samples. The main contribution of the paper with respect to previous work in the field is the introduction of a principled approach to pursue such integration. One important component of the proposed approach is played by the definition of a specific bi-level loss (efficient bilevel boosted smoothing
